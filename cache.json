I will give an overview of the data-intensive research methodology and discuss how methods, results, and data relate to each other and must be evaluated as parts of a whole: there is no such thing as a good method, nor is there a way to know if the results are good, without considering the data. I will discuss results as a window from which we can see our data, and how we can reason about the results of digital methods. I will also present the Change is Key! research program and describe our efforts to connect computational research with research questions from the humanities and social sciences.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Generations of scholars have proposed different theories explaining this expansion, which range from functionalist explanations, focusing on the provision of public goods, to conflict theories, emphasizing the role of class struggle or warfare. To quantitatively test these theories, I develop a general dynamical model, based on the theoretical framework of cultural macroevolution. Using this model and Seshat: Global History Databank I test 17 potential predictor variables proxying mechanisms suggested by major theories of sociopolitical complexity (and >100,000 combinations of these predictors). The best-fitting model indicates a strong causal role played by a combination of increasing agricultural productivity and invention/adoption of military technologies (most notably, iron weapons and cavalry in the first millennium BCE).\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

As language modeling has become more popular in the field of digital humanities as well, it has become apparent that this hurdle exactly can be very high for researchers to be able to make use of traditional language modeling methods. This contribution demonstrates how to improve the semantic quality of pre-trained word embeddings that have been built using a smaller English text corpus by incorporating structured knowledge (synonyms, antonyms, and hypernyms). Using the state-of-the-art method GLEN (Generalized Lexical ENtailment model, Glavaš and Vulić 2019), the experiment shows mixed results: While semantic similarity and lexical entailment show improvements, the performance for semantic relatedness falls behind in this setting. However, limiting the training data to only synonyms improves semantic relatedness as well, which implies that using more but diverse training data is not always advisable when wanting to improve the semantic quality of a smaller word embedding model, as this goal merges a variety of semantic aspects.\n Link to poster\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

However, with the help of computational techniques, words can be converted to numerical data and certain parts of a text can be examined on a large scale. Textual elements such as sentence length, word length and lexical diversity, which are associated by scholars on the one hand with the writing style of an individual author and on the other with the complexity of a text and the intended age of its readers, can thus be subjected to statistical evaluation. In this paper, data from little under 700 English and Dutch books written for different ages is analysed using a statistical linear mixed model. The results show that the textual elements studied are better qualified to detect the age of the intended reader of a text than the identity or age of the author.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Rising interest in the book, amplified by the success of the recent screen adaptation, has aroused curiosity regarding its realization. We use Rolling Delta and Rolling Classify to detect stylistic signals from each author as these methods reveal authorial takeovers. The same techniques are applied to compare the screenplay of the show to the novel. The results indicate that  Good Omens  resembles Pratchett’s work more closely. The screenplay is correctly attributed to Gaiman, its sole author, and the comparison reveals that Gaiman may have relied less on the source material over the course of the narrative arc.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Rather than computing relative frequencies as the number of occurrences of a given word divided by the total number of tokens in a text, I argue that a more efficient normalization factor is the total number of  relevant  tokens only. The notion of relevant words includes synonyms and, usually, a few dozen other words in some ways semantically similar to a word in question. To determine such a semantic background, one of word embedding models can be used. The proposed method outperforms classical most-frequent-word approaches substantially, usually by a few percentage points depending on the input settings.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Accordingly, a lot of research has been dedicated to the documentation of tools as well as to the analysis of their impact from an epistemological perspective. In this paper we propose a binary and a multi-class classification approach to detect and classify tools. The approach builds on state-of-the-art neural language models. We test our model on two different corpora and report the results for different parameter configurations in two consecutive experiments. In the end, we demonstrate how the models can be used for actual tool detection and tool classification tasks in a large corpus of DH journals.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

The basic   unit are scenes and the motif repertoire instantiated in the scene. The motif repertoire   consists of three sets of (closely related) elements: character stereotypes, types of   verbal actions and action types. It is assumed that the motif repertoire is highly   dependent on the corpus which is analyzed, in our case a corpus of romance and horror   novels published as pulp fiction. The resulting information is represented in a temporal   graph which in turn is used to compute relevant information on the scenes and   characters. Scenes are also characterized by their valence and their arousal value. A second representation which offers with a topic model of the direct speech and the  narrative text a simple proxy for the types of verbal actions and the action types is also created. To assess the ability of these information structures to indicate changes   in the temporal structures three evaluation methods are used based on artificial data.   We can confirm that a very abstract representation of the plot is able to do so, but   contrary to our expectations the more information-rich model which makes use of the   topic model is not better in doing so. The main contribution of this paper is its   attempt to integrate different research proposals into one integral model. We offer a   descriptive framework and a proposal for the formal model of plot, which makes it   possible to identify research problems and align existing approaches.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

A large body of scholarship known as ``thing theory’’ has attempted to understand the function of fictional things within literature mostly by focusing on small case studies. We provide the first-ever estimates of the distribution of different types of things in English-language fiction over the past two centuries along with experiments to model their semantic identity. Our findings suggest that the most common fictional things are structural in nature, functioning akin to narrative props. We conclude by showing how these findings pose problems for inherited theories of fictional things and propose an alternative theoretical framework, embodied cognition, as a way of understanding the predominance of structural things.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

This paper presents a study that uses literary reviews as a proxy for aesthetic judgment in order to identify systematic components that can be attributed to bias. Specifically, we find that judgments of literary quality differ across media types and display a gender bias. In newspapers, male reviewers have a same-gender preference while female reviewers show an opposite–gender preference. On the other hand, in the blogosphere female reviewers prefer female authors. While alternative accounts exist of this apparent gender disparity, we argue that it reflects a cultural gender antagonism that is necessary to take into account when doing computational assessment of aesthetics.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

It derives from the broader otaku culture, which is also associated with video games, manga, cosplay, anime, and other forms of Japanese popular culture. Though the light novel lacks the global reach of some of these other genres, such as manga and anime, it nonetheless attracts millions of readers across a range of gender and age groups. While distinct subgenres of the light novel have emerged, such as romance, adventure, horror, and harem, issues of gender stereotyping, power imbalances and other forms of inequality remain strongly entrenched. These issues can be attributed to how otaku culture is rooted in heterosexual male desire. This paper offers a quantitative assessment of these issues of gender inequality. We analyze 290 light novels, scraped from the Baka-Tsuki Translation Community Wiki, in terms of the power relationships between female and male characters as they evolve over the course of each novel. We find patterns consistent with issues of gender stereotyping and power differentials. More specifically, we find that female characters consistently wield less power than male characters, especially toward the end of each novel. We find some variation in specific subgenres. We conclude with close readings of two light novels, demonstrating how a power frames approach to analyzing gender stereotypes in otaku culture augments existing work on the subject.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

However it is not a straightforward task, as genre labels can be ambiguous and subject to temporal change, and moreoever many books consist of mixed or miscellaneous genres. In this paper we describe a work-in-progress method by which genre predictions can be used to determine longer sequences of genre change within books, which we test out with visualisations of some hand-picked texts. We apply state-of-the-art methods to the task, including a BERT-based transformer and character-level Perceiver model, both pre-trained on a large collection of eighteenth century works (ECCO), using a new set of hand-annotated documents created to reflect historical divisions. Results show that both models perform significantly better than a linear baseline, particularly when ECCO-BERT is combined with tfidf features, though for this task the character-level model provides no obvious advantage. Initial evaluation of the genre sequence method shows it may in the future be useful in determining and dividing the multiple genres of miscellaneous and hybrid historical texts.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Outside of classical meters, describing the metrical structure of a poem in a large corpus requires expertise and a shared scientific theory. In a situation when both components are lacking, alternative and continuous measures of regularity can be envisioned. This paper focuses on poetic rhythm to propose a simple entropy-based measure for poem regularity using counts of non-stressed intervals. The measure is validated using subsets of a well-annotated Russian poetic corpus, prose, and quasi-poems (prose chopped into lines). The regularity measure is able to detect a clear difference between various organizational principles of texts: average entropy rises when moving from accentual-syllabic meters to accentual variations to free verse and prose. Interval probabilities, when taken as a vector of features, also allow for classification at the level of individual poems. This paper argues that distinguishing between meter as a cultural idea and rhythm as an empirical sequence of sounds can lead to better understanding of form recognition and prosodic annotation problems.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Discussed topics varied from records of price fluctuations to local politics, and from weather reports to remarkable gossip. What we do not know yet, is to what extent times of conflict and crises influenced the way in which people dealt with information. We have applied methods from information theory – dynamics in word usage and measures of relative entropy such as  novelty  and  resonance  – to a corpus of early modern chronicles from the Low Countries (1500–1820) to provide more insight in the way early modern people were coping with information during impactful events. We detect three peaks in the novelty signal, which coincide with times of political uncertainty in the Northern and Southern Netherlands. Topic distributions provided by Top2Vec show that during these times, chroniclers tend to write more and more extensively about an increased variation of topics.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

However, not all sources that are relevant to the historian’s inquiry may have survived the test of time. Consequently, the resulting data can be biased in unknown ways, possibly skewing analyses. This paper deals with the Dutch East India Company its digitized ledgers of contracts. We apply an unseen species model, a method from ecology, to estimate the  actual  number of unique seafarers contracted. We find that the lower bound of actual seafarers is much higher than what the remaining contracts indicate: at least, thirty-six percent of the seafarers is unknown. Moreover, we find that even in periods when few records survived, we can still credibly estimate a lower bound on the unique number of seafarers.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

In this paper, we propose a unified, formal framework for two fundamental questions in the study of the transmission of texts: how much was lost or preserved from all works of the past, and why do their genealogies (their \"phylogenetic trees’‘) present the very peculiar shapes that we observe or, more precisely, reconstruct? We argue here that these questions share similarities to those encountered in evolutionary biology, and can be described in terms of \"genetic’’ drift and \"natural’’ selection.  Through agent-based models, we show that such properties as have been observed by philologists since the 1800s can be simulated, and confronted to data gathered for ancient and medieval texts across Europe, in order to obtain plausible estimations of the number of works and manuscripts that existed and were lost.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Correlating the bottom-up, linguistic feature driven clustering with text type distinctions (medium and register) enables us to quantify the influence of individual author choice and medium/register conventions on variable linguistic phenomena. Our pilot study applies the method to German particles and intensifiers in a multimedia corpus, annotated for register. We show that German particles and intensifiers differ across both register and medium. The clustering based on the linguistic features most closely corresponds to the medium distinction, while the stratification into registers is reflected to a lesser extent.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

To do this, we used Bert Emotion to assign probability scores for eight different emotions to each text in a time series of 43 million Danish tweets from 2019-2022. We find that variance in the information signals novelty and resonance reliably identify seasonal shifts in posting behavior, particularly around the Christmas holiday season, whereas variance in  the distribution of emotion scores corresponds to more local events such as major inflection points in the Covid-19 pandemic in Denmark. This work in progress suggests that emotion scores are a useful tool for diagnosing shifts in the baseline information state of social media platforms such as Twitter, and for understanding how social media systems respond to both predictable and unexpected external events.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Governmental decisions, notarial deeds and official charters often contain fixed expressions to ensure that the same legal aspects in different documents had the same interpretation.  Such formulaic expressions can be used to identify specific elements of a document. For instance, a deed has different formulas to indicate whether it concerns the sale of property or the transferal of rights.  In this paper we explore formulas as a methodological devise to structure the text of an administrative corpus and make the information contained in it better accessible. We use a data-driven method to detect potential formulaic expressions in historical corpora, that can deal with spelling variation and change and recognition errors introduced in the digitisation process. We apply this exploratory technique on a corpus of almost 300,000 eighteenth-century resolutions of the States General of the Dutch Republic and find many formulaic expressions that capture relationships between the political actors involved and the decisions that were made. A first analysis suggests that many formulas can be used to add metadata to individual resolutions on various elements of the proposals and decisions that are part of each resolution.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

This short paper introduces a way of operationalizing functional diversity measurements by means of token-based embeddings, and argues that functional diversity is not only a practically advantageous, but also a theoretically relevant addition to the Computational Humanities Research toolkit. By means of an experiment on the historical ARCHER corpus, we show that lexical diversity at the level of functional groups is less sensitive to orthographic variation, and provides insight into an important and often disregarded dimension of vocabulary diversity in textual data.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Increasingly, the perceived value of goods was not only determined by the intrinsic quality of the goods, but also by the socio-commercial discourse used to characterise them. Linguistic modifiers, such as adjectives, must have played an important role in this process – reflecting these socio-economical trends in text while also reinforcing them. Here, we focus on a diachronic corpus of over 5,000 pages of London auction advertisement pages, digitised via automated transcription and divided across four sample periods between 1742-1829. Prime methodological challenges include: (1) the noisiness of the available data because of imperfect transcription; (2) the coarseness of the available time stamps, and (3) the lack of suitable NLP software, such as lemmatizers or (shallow) syntactic parsers. Through the use of word embeddings, we try to alleviate the issue of spelling variation with reasonable success. We find that, over time, subjective or ‘evaluative’ modifiers have become more prominent in these advertisements than their objective or ‘descriptive’ counterparts – but there are different temporal patterns for different types of advertised objects\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Fine-tuning a BERT Model to Explore a Stylistic Phenomenon\nAbstract: The narrative work of well-known Italian author Italo Calvino (1923-1985) features a phenomenon that literary critics refer to as ``dubitative text’': this stylistic device consciously hinders the narrative progression of a story, by questioning its own content. We report on an attempt to model the presence of dubitative text in Calvino’s fictional oeuvre and examine whether this model can also be used to retrieve dubitative instances in his essayistic oeuvre. We hypothesize that precisely the category of the dubitative text yields interesting points of intersection between both writing modes. We fine-tuned a BERT model based on a manually annotated dataset and report inter-annotator scores. We situate our findings and model criticism in the current landscape of Calvino scholarship. While detecting dubitative text is challenging, our model provides fresh insights into the device’s surface features.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Also, new Latin comedies are again written in quantities never seen before (at least 10,000 works published 1500 to 1800 are known). The authors themselves, within the game of literary imitation (the process of  imitatio), start to mimic the style of ancient authors, and Terence’s dramas in particular were considered the prime sources of reuse for many decades.   Via a case study “the reception of Terence’s  Eunuchus  in Early Modern literature”, we take a deep dive into the mechanisms of literary imitation. Our analysis is based on four comedy corpora in Latin, Italian, French and English, spanning roughly 3 centuries (1400-1700). To assess the problem of language shift and multi-language inter-corpora analysis, we base our experiments on translations of the  Eunuchus , one for each sub-corpus. Through the use of tools drawn from the field of Stylometry, we address the topic of text reuse and textual similarities between Terence’s text and Early-Modern corpora to get a better grasp on the internal fluctuations of the imitation game between Early Modern and Classical authors.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Combining these perspectives, in this work we study character networks extracted from a text corpus of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Legendarium. We show that this perspective helps us to analyse and visualise the narrative style that characterises Tolkien’s works. Addressing character classification, embedding and co-occurrence prediction, we further investigate the advantages of state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks over a popular word embedding method.

We present a study on the relation between sentiment fractality and literary appreciation by testing the hypothesis that fairy tales with a good balance between unpredictability and excessive self-similarity in their sentiment narrative arcs tend to be more popular and more appreciated by audiences of readers. In short, we perform a correlation study of the degree of fractality of the fairy tales of the Grimm brothers and their current appreciation as measured by their Goodreads scores. Moreover, we look at the popularity of these fairy tales through time, determining which ones have come to form a strong “internal canon” in the corpus of the authors and which one have fallen into relative obscurity.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

With highly complex layouts and mixed scripts, scholarly commentaries are text-heavy documents which remain challenging for state-of-the-art models. Their layout considerably varies across editions and their most important regions are mainly defined by semantic rather than graphical characteristics such as position or appearance. This setting calls for a comparison between textual, visual and hybrid approaches. We therefore assess the performances of two transformers (LayoutLMv3 and RoBERTa) and an objection-detection network (YOLOv5). If results show a clear advantage in favor of the latter, we also list several caveats to this finding. In addition to our experiments, we release a dataset of ca. 300 annotated pages sampled from 19th  century commentaries.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

These images are widely reproduced and recognised and can therefore be considered memorable. A question that arises given such images is whether the memorability of iconic images is intrinsic or whether it is shaped. In this work we analyse the memorability of iconic images by means of computational  techniques that are specifically designed to measure the intrinsic memorability of images. To judge whether iconic images are inherently more memorable we establish two baselines based on datasets of diverse imagery and of newspaper imagery. Our findings show that iconic images are not more memorable than modern day newspaper imagery or when compared to a diverse set of everyday images. In fact, by and large many of the iconic images analysed score on the low end of the memorability spectrum. Additionally, we explore the variation in memorability of reproductions of iconic images  and find that certain images have been edited resulting in higher memorability scores,  but that the images by and large are reproduced with memorability close to the original.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Getting models robust to scribal and material changes is a necessary step for specific data mining tasks. However, evaluation of HTR results requires ground truth to compare prediction statistically. In the context of modern languages, successful attempts to evaluate quality have been done using lexical features or n-grams. This, however, proves difficult in the context of spelling variation that both Old French and Latin have, even more so in the context of sometime heavily abbreviated manuscripts. We propose a new method based on deep learning where we attempt to categorize each line error rate into four error rate ranges ( 0 < 10 %  < 25  %  < 50 %  < 100 % ) using three different encoder (GRU with Attention, BiLSTM, TextCNN). To train these models, we propose a new dataset engineering approach using early stopped model, as an alternative to rule-based fake predictions. Our model largely outperforms the n-gram approach. We also provide an example application to qualitatively analyse our classifier, using classification on new prediction on a sample of 1,800 manuscripts ranging from the 9th century to the 15th.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

          "description": "17 Feb 2023 - 00:00\n\n\n\nCfP: UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Association launches Community Interest Groups\n\n\n\nThe Association is announcing a Call for Proposals for Community Interest Groups (CIGs) - community-driven groups which are organised around a specific research interest, an existing community of practice, or a salient issue within the digital humanities community.\nThese groups will serve as one of the primary vehicles for community building within the Association. They will help the Association become more inclusive, collaborative, and sustainable by providing spaces that respond to community needs.\nCIGs are meant to be flexible, so that CIGs can emerge, transform and disband as priorities change within the field. CIGs will receive support from the Association, including use of the Association’s social media channels, a place on the Association’s website, the opportunity to participate in Association events, regular chances to feedback on issues related to the CIG’s area of interest, and formal opportunities to collaborate with other CIGs and external organisations.\nFor information about the proposal process, please see the instructions here: https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/resources/cig_cfp/\nProposals can be submitted to uk-ie.digitalhumanities@sas.ac.uk by 5:00 PM GMT on Friday, 17 February 2023. If you have any questions about the process, please email uk-ie.digitalhumanities@sas.ac.uk.\nIf you'd like to learn more about the Association, please visit our website at https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/",

          "description": "New Cinema History broadened film studies by emphasising the complexity of cinema as a multifaceted phenomenon that includes the socio-economic context in which films were made, circulated, shown and received. As part of the digital turn, the discipline adopted computational methods and created quantitative research data to research this socio-economic context at scale. However, not all datasets created in this context adhere to FAIR principles, decreasing their reusability. By reconciling 14 cinema-related datasets, Cinema Belgica facilitates research into the history of Belgian cinema. This research paper documents and critically reflects on the choices made when selecting, modelling and reconciling information for the Cinema Belgica database.\n Published on 2023-01-13 10:33:40",

It was constituted by collecting, validating, and curating information from pan-European, language-based, and national union catalogues. A complementary and interconnected “data package” was deposited on Zenodo, comprising: (1) a classical text-based bibliography, supplemented by (2) a CSV dataset of information contained therein, (3) the images of title pages not readily available online, and (4) a comprehensive BibTeX dataset. The CC can be reused in further internal research on the history of critique and as a model for research on the history of other concepts and ideas.\n Published on 2022-12-14 10:33:41",

It will be updated with additional data each time the course is taught. The data set comprises geo/historical data about movie theaters (cinemas) and exhibition in the state from approximately 1894 to 1929. The data is presented on a public website (https://oregontheaterproject.uoregon.edu/) which includes maps and individual theater profiles produced by the students. All profiles, and the underlying data, are reviewed by the course instructors and edited as needed for clarification or accuracy. Profiles include, where available, the theater name, address, city, state, latitude, longitude, number of seats, owner/manager names, and a narrative description. The underlying data, shared as Excel documents and tab-delimited spreadsheets, invites historical comparative analysis of film exhibition practices across time and locale, both local and global.\n Published on 2022-12-12 11:37:02",

          "description": "In this paper we present the first-ever procedure for identifying highly similar sequences of text in Chinese and Tibetan translations of Buddhist sūtra literature. We initially propose this procedure as an aid to scholars engaged in the philological study of Buddhist documents. We create a cross-lingual embedding space by taking the cosine similarity of average sequence vectors in order to produce unsupervised similar cross-linguistic parallel alignments at word, sentence, and even paragraph level. Initial results show that our method lays a solid foundation for the future development of a fully-fledged Information Retrieval tool for these (and potentially other) low-resource historical languages.\n Published on 2022-10-04 11:18:29",

          "description": "The digital representation and publishing of human history on the web has so far been stuck at the digital unlocking of collections of historical items. Those collections are described by metadata mostly for curation and for findability metadata that are put on the web in the manner of a library catalog. Usually, there is little on ‘aboutness’. This is unfortunate, as modern representations of knowledge and web-based interactive presentation techniques offer ample opportunities for a more complex representation and richer interaction with digital history. In this contribution, we argue for a history in digital data that is treated for what it is: an interpretation, like all history, while remaining traceable to its information carriers.\n Published on 2022-09-02 10:08:20",

          "description": "Drama Critiques’ dataset was produced as part of Mylène Maignant’s PhD project at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (Ulm) between 2018 and 2022. Her research aims to explore the reception of contemporary London theatre (2010 to 2020) by analysing a large corpus based on the reviews written by two distinct groups of theatre critics: the journalistic one on the one hand, and the digital one on the other hand (bloggers). By relying partly on the data made available by Theatre Record (https://www.theatrerecord.com/) and by automatically extracting the content of 28 blogs, we built a corpus constituting more than 40,000 theatre reviews. Only 36,000 are open access, as some of the bloggers have not given their authorisation yet. The purpose of this data collection consisted of exploring the similarities and differences between these two literary communities. We were interested in better understanding the cultural discourse both journalists and bloggers construct. Given the amount of data, we relied on digital technologies to investigate this field. Using various digital techniques, such as computational linguistics, sentiment analysis, and Geographic Information Systems, we conducted a number of different analyses to map this cultural phenomenon. If some publications have already tackled the literary theme of English digital theatre criticism, none of them have examined it from a computational perspective. Drama Critiques’ dataset is then the first corpus which not only offers so many contemporary reviews based on journalists and bloggers’ publications, but which also proposes a study of its content (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6799656).\nRepository location: 10.5281/zenodo.6799656.\n Published on 2022-08-25 10:40:45",

The paper captures the procedure that has applied by starting from an overview about the application of ontologies to music, as well as of the so- called 'façade-based' approach to knowledge graphs, which is at the core of the SPARQL Anything software. Then, it moves to an illustration of the passages involved (i.e., melody extraction, N-grams extraction, N-grams analysis and exploitation\nof the Music Notation Ontology). Finally, it provides some considerations regarding the result of the experiment in terms of effectiveness of the queries' performance. In conclusion, the authors highlight how further studies in the field may cast an increasingly brighter light on the application of semantic-oriented methods and techniques to computational musicology. \n[Click ‘Read more’ for the full post!]",

This sets the stage for the second part that consists of 5 case studies (Statistics Essentials: WhoReads Novels? ; Introduction to Probability ; Narrating with Maps ; Stylometry and the Voice of Hildegard ; A Topic Model of United States Supreme Court Opinions, 1900–2000 ) showcasing how to draw meaningful insights from data using quantitative methods. Each chapter contains executable Python codes and ends with exercises ranging from easier drills to more creative and complex possibilities to adapt the apply and adopt the newly acquired knowledge to their own research problems.\n\nThe book exhibits best practices in how to make digital scholarship available in an open, sustainable ad digital-native manner, coming in different layers that are firmly interlinked with each other. Published with Princeton University Press in 2021, hardcopies are also available, but more importantly, the digital version is an  Open Access Jupyter notebook that can be read in multiple environments and formats (.md and .pdf). The documentation, coda and data materials are available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/3560761#.Y3tCcn3MJD9).

Recent publications taking advantage of such digital affordances have included monographs, enhanced journals, hybrid digital & print projects, as well as podcasts. How are these projects designed and developed to be sustainable, discoverable, and accessible in the long term? Who is publishing them? And how can graduate students and early career scholars acquire the skills and/or find support to develop digital publications? \nThis presentation will address how academic publishers are approaching multimodal born-digital and hybrid publications, as well as how libraries are supporting contemporary digital publishing methods. In particular it will introduce the range of recent scholarly digital publications and the University Presses actively seeking proposals. It will also touch on considerations for developing a digital publication, including the DH skill set learning curve, pitching a project to an editor, writing for a public audience, platforms, preservation, and accessibility, and resources for getting started.\n\n\nSubtitle: \n\nMultimodal Digital Scholarship\n\n\nImage for Left Column:",

If you’ve ever made something, it is likely that you’ve experienced failure. Lots of it. Or, paraphrasing Samuel Beckett, hopefully you have failed better. Over the last decade, game designers John Sharp and Colleen Macklin have interviewed creative practitioners—from chefs to skateboarders, filmmakers to winemakers, and toy designers to comedians to see how they manage the inevitable failures encountered in their practices. Join Sharp and Macklin as they share some of the lessons they’ve learned from game design and other creative disciplines. Because while everyone fails, some do it better. Because without f…",

A service provider as well as a device maker, Apple brands its media productions as exactingly as it does its phones, tablets, computers, and watches. As a result, its content is branded in ways that Netflix and HBO Max’s, for example, is not; indeed, Apple’s still relatively small stable of film and TV content expresses the firm’s manufacturing interests in ways that even Sony’s content, say, does not. This talk establishes the coherence of Apple’s TV branding and asks how it should matter to a materialist critical practice. Specifically, it asks if the very coherence of Apple’s trans-corporate branding makes it possible to glimpse in Apple content the otherwise hidden, outsourced, upstream production processes upon which the company still depends.\nMichael Szalay is Professor of English at the University of California, Irvine. He teaches 20th- and 21st-century fiction, television, and film, as well as courses on World-Systems Theory and the origins of capitalism. His first two books (Hip Figures: A Literary History of the Democratic Party and New Deal Modernism: American Literature and the Invention of the Welfare State) examine the relationship between literature, liberal governance, and economic crisis. His forthcoming book, Second Lives: Black-Market Melodramas and the Reinvention of Television (Chicago, 2023), defines a new television genre—the black-market melodrama—that has driven the ascent of TV as a cultural force over the last two decades, and that continues to mediate the ongoing effects of deindustrialization on a changing U.S. middle class.\n \n\n\nSubtitle: \n\nOvercoming Severance, from Lumon to Foxconn\n\n\nImage for Left Column:",

We seek to understand the ways in which the canon of Russian literature was conceptualized and composed differently in different translated contexts; to query Pascale Casanova’s claim that Paris was the most important “capital” of the “World Republic of Letters”; and to determine which other locales played a significant role in the process of a “peripheral” literature’s incorporation into “world literature” in the space of less than a century.\n19C RLT currently tracks book publications of works by Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky into English, French, and German from the death of Pushkin in 1837 to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, comprising a growing database as well as maps, graphs, and other visualizations of the data. Future phases are planned to add more authors and expand the scope to include other global contexts in which Russian literature became an important translated literature in the twentieth century and beyond.\nContributors:\nScott Bartling\nAndrew Basile\nRachel Dennis\nEmily Despinoy\nCatherine Fantuzzo\nAisha Garaeva\nEkaterina Kokovikhina\nSergey Miroshkin\nJan Nowak\nLydia Shaw\nEugenia Ulanova\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert an Image: \n\n\n\n\nCo-Investigators: \n\nHilah Kohen (Penn)\nOlga Nechaeva (Penn)\nJ.D.

Scholars have illuminated the impact of redlining on  mortgage lending, demonstrating how African American homebuyers, in particular, were often locked out of the midcentury housing boom. This project shifts the focus to FHA-insured apartment complexes. Drawing upon  a comprehensive data set FHA mortgage insurance data that catalogues more than 50,000 FHA-insured apartment buildings, the project maps the location, size (by unit count), and construction dates of roughly 7,000 projects constructed under the FHA wartime housing program (Section 608, 1942-1950). Future versions of the map may include FHA-backed market-rate multifamily housing (Section 207) as well as multifamily rental projects on urban renewal sites (Section 220) and for those displaced from urban renewal sites (Section 221).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert an Image: \n\n\n\n\nCo-Investigators: \n\nLaura Eckstein and J.D.

Each National Epics author also contributes to nationalepics.com, initially by briefly discussing how a designated territorial space shapes or is shaped by \"epical\" texts that tell its story to the world. Collectively and cumulatively, we will help augment the emergent disciplinary field known as critical nationalism studies.\nNationalepics.com is developing in parallel with National Epics, a collaborative work of c. 83 or 84 chapters, to be published by Oxford University Press (UK) and edited by David Wallace. While National Epics suggests a stabilized outcome, a multi-volume book with reference value, nationalepics.com evokes the process of getting there, acknowledging that the nature and dynamics of nationalism, and the texts that serve or subvert it, never rest. And while most such large-scale projects develop behind closed doors, nationalepics.com aims to share resources and air critical issues along the way.\nInteractive map and Website development by Cassandra Hradil, Digital Humanities Specialist, Penn Libraries & Price Lab for Digital Humanities\n\n\nInsert an Image: \n\n\n\n\nProject Principal Investigator: \n\nDavid  Wallace",

          "description": "Detecting Genre in Pitchfork Reviews\n\n\nProject Start Date: \n\nAugust, 2021\n\n\n\nWe analyze 23,000 reviews from Pitchfork.com to establish a network of over 7,000 artists based on their co-presence in reviews. We use Gephi's (Louvain community detection) modularity class feature to sort the network into closely connected groups. However, because this process is non-deterministic, we improve on its results by running it 10,000 times. Using this novel \"metamodularity\" method we can show how often any two artists were sorted into the same group. For instance, the jazz musician Alice Coltrane was grouped with John Coltrane 10,000 times, with Sly and the Family Stone 4,939 times, and with Guns n’ Roses one time. With these data, we can visualize how the largely undifferentiated mass of artists fragments into more and more connected groups could be described as genres. \nWhile some of the genres suggested by this method are incredibly specific, one notable exception is the group of African American musicians, which is remarkably large and stable. The artists within it range from Flying Lotus to Motown legend Marvin Gaye to trap rapper Young Thug to R&B singer-songwriter Sade to gangster rapper Tupac Shakur to funk innovators Funkadelic to cross-over hip hop star Cardi B. This is a far more capacious group than most rock clusters along aesthetic, market, and even historic grounds. This may reflect real world connections, yet it is also possible that this metamodularity difference reflects a bias at Pitchfork, where a (historically) rock-oriented hipster aesthetic and a (historically) largely white male audience may correspond to a relative lack of nuance when covering Black artists (historically). In any case, it is fair to say based on these data that Pitchfork has written about Black artists in a structurally unique way over the years relative to their coverage of white artists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert an Image: \n\n\n\n\nProject Principal Investigator: \n\nJ.D.

But the undoubted convenience of  being able to browse 200 years worth of newspapers at home masks other  issues that historians have been slow to acknowledge and address. How do we discover relevant resources? What gets digitised and why? How can  researchers use these collections to ask new types of questions? After more than 25 years, the web has its own history. What problems and  possibilities has it brought to the way we understand the past?\nIt’s available as a green open access preprint on Zenodo.",

          "description": "The Trove Newspaper Harvester has been around in different forms for more than a decade. It helps you download all the articles in a Trove newspaper search, opening up new possibilities for large-scale analysis. You can use it as a command-line tool by installing a Python package, or through the Trove Newspaper Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench.\nI’ve just overhauled development of the Python package. The new trove-newspaper-harvester replaces the old troveharvester repository. The command-line interface remains the same (with a few new options), so it’s really a drop in replacement. Read the full documentation of the new package for more details.\n\nHere’s a summary of the changes:\nthe package can now be used as a library (that you incorporate into your own code) as well as a standalone command-line tool – this means you can embed the harvester in your own tools or workflows\nboth the library and the CLI now let you set the names of the directories in which your harvests will be saved – this makes it easier to organise your harvests into groups and give them meaningful names\nthe harvesting process now saves results into a newline-delimited JSON file (one JSON object per line) – the library has a save_csv() option to convert this to a CSV file, while the CLI automatically converts the results to CSV to maintain compatibility with previous versions\nbehind the scenes, the package is now developed and maintained using nbdev – this means the code and documentation are all generated from a set of Jupyter notebooks\nthe Jupyter notebooks include a variety of automatic tests which should make maintenance and development much easier in the future\nI’ve also updated the Trove Newspaper Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench to use the new package. The new core library will make it easier to develop more complex harvesting examples – for example, searching for articles from a specific day across a range of years.

Many thanks to the British Library and the UK Web Archive for their support – it really makes a difference.\nThe web archives section was developed in 2020 with the support of the International Internet Preservation Consortium’s Discretionary Funding Programme, in collaboration with the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand. It’s intended to help historians, and other researchers, understand what sort of data is available through web archives, how to get it,  and what you can do with it.

Now, if there’s a link to a digitised version of the work in Trove, that link will be saved in Zotero’s url field. This makes it quicker and easier to view digitised items – just click on the ‘URL’ label in Zotero to open the link.\nIt’s also handy if you’re viewing a digitised work in Trove and want to capture the metadata about it. Just click on the ‘View catalogue’ link in the details tab of a Trove item, then use Zotero to save the details from the catalogue.",

To make it even easier, I’ve added a new endpoint to my Trove Proxy that returns the metadata in JSON format.\nJust pass the url of a digitised book or journal as a parameter named url to https://trove-proxy.herokuapp.com/metadata/. For example:\nhttps://trove-proxy.herokuapp.com/metadata/?url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-2906940941\n\nI’ve created a simple bookmarklet to make it simpler to open the proxy.

          "description": "I was looking at my Trove Newspapers Data Dashboard again last night trying to figure out why the number of newspaper articles from NSW seemed to have dropped by more than 700,000 since my harvesting began. It took me a while to figure out, but it seems that the search index was rebuilt on 31 May, and that caused some major shifts in the distribution of articles by state, as reported by the main result API. So the indexing of the articles changed, not the actual number of articles. Interestingly, the number of articles by state reported by the newspaper API doesn’t show the same fluctuations.\n\nThis adds another layer of complexity to understanding how Trove changes over time. To try and document such things, I’ve added a ‘Significant events’ section to the Dashboard. I’ve also included a new ‘Total articles by publication state’ section that compares results from the result and newspaper APIs. This should make it easier to identify such issues in the future.\nStay alert people – remember, search interfaces lie!",

The federal government planned to pass a law making all Native Americans citizens of the United States. The surveys would measure individual family’s readiness for citizenship. Among the Apsáalooke (Crow Nation), the Indian Agent surveyed 244 houses. While these surveys and photographs are instruments of surveillance, they also provide a unique snapshot into Crow daily life. However, the descendants of the families haven’t seen these photographs before. It is relatively easy to create a digital archive to rematriate the surveys. But is it possible to do something more? Can we reframe these images wrought of settler violence as family portraits?\n\n\nRebecca S. Wingo is a scholar of the I…",

Ce « petit pays » joue ainsi un rôle clé dans le secteur bancaire et financier européen et international avec le soutien de nombreux avocats, juristes et autres praticiens du droit.\nLa conférence a pour ambition de comprendre le rôle des avocats et des juristes dans le développement du Luxembourg comme centre bancaire depuis plusieurs décennies. Benoît Majerus, enseignant-chercheur au Centre for Contemporary and Digital History décrira dans un premier temps le rôle des avocats d’affaires dans le développement de la place financière. Le regard de l’historien sera ensuite complété par celui du journaliste Pierre Sorlut du D’Lëtzebuerger Land qui se penchera sur l’émergence et le succès des cabinets d’avocats d’affaires au Luxembourg ainsi que leur contribution au développement de la place financière. Puis Catherine Bourin, juriste et membre du comité de direction de l’ABBL, qui est l’organisation professionnelle représentant la majorité des banques de la place, clôturera la conférence par une intervention intitulée « Le droit et la place financière : bilan et prospectives ».\n \nMercredi, 8 février 2023\nDébut: 19:00 heures\nBibliothèque nationale du Luxembourg\n37D Avenue John F.

          "description": "The deportation of Crimean Tatars was a state-organized and forcible eviction of Crimean Tatars people that was ordered by Joseph Stalin as a form of collective punishment in 1944. It was supposed to completely remove the Crimean Tatar nationality from the demographic map of the world. It ruined the traditional way of life, social structure, and cultural institutes of Crimean Tatars. Indeed, Crimean Tatars were supposed to assimilate in exile. As a result of state-sponsored violence, Crimean Tatars became a nation in exile. After Stalin's death they did not receive the right to return to Crimea and renew their autonomy, like most \"punished peoples.\" However, Crimean Tatars escaped the fate and managed to reshape their identity. Moreover, despite the ban, Crimean Tatars tried to return to their homeland during the Soviet era.\nIn the presentation the question \"How did Crimean Tatars returnees dealt with 'homecoming'?\" will be answered. Studying the Crimean Tatars' return contribute significantly not only to the history of Crimean Tatars, moreover, it is important for the understanding of reverse migration process in migration studies. The research, foremost, is based on oral history interviews. So the special attention will be paid to doing Oral History in Crimea.\n \n\n\n \nA historian of Crimean Tatars, Martin-Oleksandr Kisly (History Department of National university of Kyiv-Mohyla academy) holds a Candidate of Science degree, having defended a dissertation entitled \"Crimean Tatars’ Return to the Homeland in 1956–1989\". His research focuses on memory, trauma, identity and migration. Fulbright Research and Development program fellow (2017, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor).

          "description": "Mixed Reality, in its many forms, is generally characterised by its audiovisual, spatial and immersive nature, blending virtual content with elements of physical reality into an arrangement that allows users to physically walk through and interact with the resulting three-dimensional hybrid space. Due to these qualities cultural institutions worldwide are experimenting with new ways of communicating, reviving and preserving cultural heritage. The session will show how adapting a body-based design approach that goes beyond the audiovisual can bring about new forms of learning and understanding history.\nKatharina Tillmanns is a researcher, designer and lecturer for interactive immersive media at TH Köln (https://colognegamelab.de). A former co-president of the Games for Change Europe network and director of the Notgames Fest, she has been exploring and promoting the expressive qualities of games and other playful media as a means of art and activism for the past 12+ years. Currently Katharina is focusing on her dissertation research, which examines multi-sensory learning in the context of mixed reality environments.\n \n \nMonday, 12 December 2022\n17.00 – 18:30\nMaison du Savoir.

          "description": "Germany’s “Century of Sex” (D. Herzog) offers a case in point for studying gender ambivalences in (post)war contexts. Though gender and sexuality are “useful categories of historical analysis” (Joan W. Scott), they remain profoundly recalcitrant, as they combine liberalisation and repression, consent and violence, the private and the public… As I shall argue, masculinities offer insightful perspectives for understanding German society and Europe at war. Nazism, which advocated an ideal of comradeship and racial purity, regulated gender, sexualities and procreation through racist, homophobic, sexist and eugenic laws. Yet the period also saw the coexistence of sexual constraints and forms of gender violence with the opening of new spaces for sexual and gender experimentation. The Nazi war of…",

          "description": "Taking the post-conflict context of Northern Ireland as a case study, this lecture will explore some of the challenges of engaging in Public History in a region where the prevailing historical narratives are contested at the most basic level. It will ask to what extent the public use of history plays a part in reinforcing divisions and continuing senses of ‘otherness’. However, it will also look at the important role public history can play in such contexts either as a form of conflict transformation, disrupting dominant narratives and opening up space for dialogue, or as a means of promoting wellbeing and increased senses of belonging among divided and often disadvantaged urban communities. \n \n\nMonday, 14 November 2022\n18.00 - 19.00 CET\nAquarium, 4th floor, Maison des Sciences humaines\n11, Porte des Sciences humaines\nL-4366 Esch-sur-Alzette\nand online\n\n\n\nPlease register if you want to participate in-person or online.\n \nLegal notice\n\n14 November 2022\n  Public history\n  Public History as the New Citizen Science of the Past (PHACS)\n  Public History\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Comment tissait-on des liens entre sidérurgistes ou mineurs ? Comment déjouait-on les surveillances des gardes pour sortir du materiel ? Comment s’arrangeait-on pour « bricoler » sur place des objets qu’on ramenait ensuite à la maison ou dans son jardin ? Comment prenait-on des libertés sur les règlements ? Et qu’est devenue avec le temps cette autonomie ouvrière connue mais peu racontée ? Au final, à quoi servaient ces systèmes de transgression ?\n« L’usine secrète » dresse un portrait original et inhabituel du monde ouvrier et de ses évolutions sur 50 ans.

At the core of this project lays the emergent concept of 'slow memory', that is intended to help us think from new angles about how societies and individuals remember the pasts that meaningfully affect their present and future. It begins from the premise that we are quite skilled (and have much practice) commemorating sudden or extreme events such as wars, atrocities or catastrophes. But we are less certain about how to reckon with slow-moving transformations that may be just as impactful, such as climate change, deindustrialization, or the gradual expansion of social and political rights.\n \nWednesday, 21 September 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space\n21 September 2022\n  Digital history & historiography\n  Digital methods  Methodology\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

The first phase of this project involved community workshops and crowdsourcing to collect photographs of potential objects to present at this exhibition. The second phase consisted of the categorisation of these objects by our Citizen Historian Circle (CHiC) and an online vote to select the objects for the exhibition.\nThe everyday objects bear witness to a personal approach to history. They tell the story of workers, sportsmen, or the distant past of the city. The free exhibition will showcase 25 of the most popular objects in the Pop-Up store in the shopping street of Esch-sur-Alzette. Each visitor will receive an exhibition catalogue in their preferred language (French, Luxembourgish or English) to read the personal anecdote and historical context of the object.\n \nOpening hours\n2 – 24 September, Monday – Saturday from 13.00-18.00.\nFree entrance.\nLocation\nPop-Up Store, 121 Rue de l'Alzette, 4011 Esch-sur-Alzette\nFor more information, visit our website at www.historesch.lu or contact us at info@historesch.lu.\n2 September 2022 to 24 September 2022\n  Public History as the New Citizen Science of the Past (PHACS)\n  Public History  Regional history\n  Outreach\n  Published  \nPhoto credits: Jo Diseviscourt",

Over the course of the year, many CLARIN Cafés were held, research was showcased in the Impact Stories, CLARIN  training materials made their way to new user groups, and CLARIN launched its first promotional video.\nOn this year’s holiday card, we proudly present some of these highlights with six hidden links, including a final message from Franciska de Jong, looking back at her time as Executive Director.\nThank you for a wonderful year – happy holidays and best wishes for 2023!\nView the Holiday Card\n\n      Elisa Gorgaini\n 14 December 2022",

I started to work for CLARIN in the summer of 2015, the beginning of a journey that brought many moments of discovery, the unravelling of complexity, achievements, innovation and growth. Language matters, and therefore language resources matter. So leading the mission of making them findable and accessible, and pointing out the potential for impact along many dimensions of the richness that has been collected, annotated and deposited, in growing volumes and for a wide diversity of languages, has been a deeply rewarding role. The journey also brought many moments of personal inspiration and satisfaction, not least because of the many moments of warm collegial collaboration and exchange.\nAnd the future? The landscape of research infrastructures in which CLARIN is positioned is very dynamic and there always seem to be new horizons. But even though some of the envisaged scenarios for the future may never materialise, I trust that there will be a multitude of ways in which another generation of experts can show the way for CLARIN to be able to adapt to new conditions and policy frameworks. Being a crucial building block for any new stage that will result from the evolutionary path taken, that is what I wish for CLARIN. And of course that it can continue its role in enhancing the options for exploring the cultural and societal diversity that is reflected in language.

Yet, they are typically planned, performed and evaluated separately, often by different teams. This means that many possibilities for cross-fertilisation between the two domains are missed. One way to avoid this is through engagement in research-based teaching (RBT), with a special focus on the integration of ongoing research into teaching.

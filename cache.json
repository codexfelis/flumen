Unlike most existing video analysis tools that focus on individual videos, our approach allows for an overview of a larger collection of videos, which can be further examined based on their connections or communities. By utilizing scalable reading, specific subgraphs can be selected from the overview and their respective clusters can be explored in more detail on the video frame level.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

In this paper we investigate whether the use of formulas in the Resolutions of the Dutch States General (1576-1796) reveal an increase in standardisation.     %    We use stylometric analysis and measures of textual repetition to identify shifts in the use of formulas, and study how the fraction of paragraphs that is covered by formulas changes over time to identify templates consisting of frequent combinations of formulas.   Our findings are that there are stylistically clearly distinguishable periods, and that the use of formulas and templates increases between subsequent periods.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

During the latter half of the fourteenth century, Herne served as a significant literary hotspot in the region around Brussels, with a devoted community of monks deeply involved in the production of (vernacular) texts and manuscripts, often as collaborative efforts. The corpus offers abundant material for the (computational) exploration of authorship, translation, and scribal cultures in the premodern Low Countries. Yet, much of this material has remained digitally inaccessible.  Here we describe the creation of an almost exhaustive, open-access dataset comprising diplomatic transcriptions of all known Middle Dutch Herne manuscripts, acquired through handwritten text recognition. Apart from rich codicological and textual metadata, we include a normalized text layer (with expanded abbreviations), as well as a linguistic annotation layer (with lemmas and part of speech tags). We conclude by discussing our work against current trends in medievalist scholarship. The dataset is released together with this paper and we encourage its re-use in future research.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

How do readers of digital library orient themselves within big corpora? What landmarks do they use to navigate masses of digital documents? Taking Gallica as a case study–the digital heritage platform of the French national library–, this paper presents an experimental research on the navigation practices of its users. Using methods from topological data analysis, we inferred from Gallica’s server logs an informational space as it is roamed by readers. Coupled with user interviews, this mixed-methods study allowed us to identify a set of “regimes of navigation” characterizing how readers deploy various strategies to browse the digital library’s corpus. From directed search to wandering to crawling, these regimes answer different needs and show that a single corpus can, in turns, be apprehended as a heritage collection, a database, a set of documents, and a mass of information.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Monitoring the Thematic Evolution of Medieval French Narratives\nAbstract: In this paper, we test a famous conjecture in literary history  put forward by Seignobos and de Rougemont according to which the French central medieval period (12-13th centuries) is characterized by an important increase in the cultural importance of love. To do that, we focus on the large and culturally important body of manuscripts containing medieval French long narrative fictions, in particular epics ( chansons de geste , of the Matter of France) and romances (chiefly  romans  on the Matters of Britain and of Rome), both in verse and in prose, from the 12th to the 15th century. We introduce the largest available corpus of these texts, the  Corpus of Medieval French Epics and Romances , composed of digitised manuscripts drawn from  Gallica , and processed through layout analysis and handwritten text recognition.   %  We then use  semantic representations based on embeddings  to monitor the place given to love and violence in this corpus, through time.  We observe that themes (such as the relation between love and death) and emblematic works well identified by literary history do indeed play a central part in the representation of love in the corpus, but our modelling also points to the characteristic nature of more overlooked works. Variation in time seems to show that there is indeed an phase of expansion of love in these fictions, in the 13th and early 14th century, followed by a period of contraction, that seem to correlate with the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Using an information-theoretical approach to author profiling, this paper tries to leverage some of these tools to reconstruct mental states in the Early Modern Spanish author Teresa of  ' A vila. We shift away from traditional static textual feature analysis and instead approach author profiling as a dynamic problem, requiring a representation of the author’s life history. Teresa of  ' A vila was an Early Modern Spanish mystic and Carmelite nun whose authorship offers a unique dataset due to her prolific output and well-preserved, digitized writings. We model Teresa’s letter corpus as a complex system with multiple states and try to track her mental and socio-cultural dynamics through lexical co-occurrence structures and affective valences in her letters. We find that Teresa’s letters reflect a life history of state switching between contemplation and revelation. This relatively new approach offers a more robust and dynamic perspective on author profiling in cultural heritage research.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Using neural network text embedding model to measure cultural innovation\nAbstract: Current discourse reflects a growing skepticism towards contemporary popular culture, specifically the realm of cinema, with an emerging consensus that its creative capacity is on a waning trajectory. This study introduces a novel approach which employs natural language processing techniques and embedding methods to measure semantic novelty of cultural items’ descriptions. We apply this methodology to cinema, analyzing plot summaries of over 19,000 movies from the United-States spanning more than a century. Our measure’s robustness is validated through a series of tests, including a fit with a genre-based novelty score, a manual inspection of films identified as highly innovative, and correlations with award recognitions. The application of our Innovation Score reveals a compelling pattern: an increase in the rate of cinematic innovation throughout the 20th century, followed by a stabilization in the rate of innovation in the 21st, despite an ever-growing production of films. Contrary to the often-voiced lament that cinema is losing its innovative edge, our study suggests that the level of innovativeness in cinema is not in decline.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

On one hand such interpretation is limited by the fact that data present in catalogue records is tabular and nominative, and not quantitative. On the other hand, such research is guided by tacit knowledge of scholars in the humanities, and thus it could be challenging to reproduce its results. We take inspiration from phenomenography, a discipline within educational research that examines how students perceive the phenomena being learned. We adopt the view that scientific inquiry is a collective form of learning. By doing this, we turn to the phenomenographic theory that variation is necessary to understand the phenomena being studied, and is achieved through three distinct patterns of variance: contrast, generalisation and fusion. We propose an approach to visualise the combination of nominal data and tacit knowledge by subjecting it to these three patterns. We illustrate our approach with two case studies from literary translations between Italy and the UK in the post-war 20th century. Our claim is that on one hand this guides scholars on how to analytically approach their research questions, on the other it drives them to externalise and validate hidden assumptions. Our approach offers a way of doing reproducible science not only when conducting literature research with bibliographic data. It is also applicable in the wider cases within the humanities when tabular data are available.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Corsica fitted very well within this dynamic and even presented itself as a favourable location for the development of such ideas. The centralization of the state around a strong capital and the policies of assimilation of the indigenous populations on the border with France led certain players to defend these particularisms. It was in this context that the Corsican autonomist newspaper  A Muvra  was born in May 1920 in Paris, under the impetus of Petru and Matteu Rocca. For almost 19 years, hundreds of authors participated in the writing of this massive dialectal work. This paper presents the results of a research that aimed to carry out author profiling, i.e., to determine the style and subjects covered by an author. The goals of this study were to determine the identity behind certain authors and also to highlight the role pseudonyms played in the newspaper’s propaganda. We conducted authorship attribution to achieve the first objective before completing these analyses with topic modelling in order to meet the second one.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

In an increasing body of research, emoji have variably been viewed as emotional data or personality identifiers. However, little attention has been paid to the social and political import of emoji. Using a dataset of politically active Twitter users in Poland, including 334 members of parliament and their 1,288,950 followers, we ask whether emoji are used for political self-representation, and discuss the implications for political identity formation and mobilisation online. Adapting a new method of ideal point estimation, we identify patterns in the employment of emoji in user Twitter bios across a latent political space computed from a Twitter following network. We find that emoji are used as stand-ins for offline political symbols such as  flag-european-union ,  rainbow-flag  and  latin-cross . Additionally, we find that the use of emoji without recognisable political meaning, such as  victory-hand ,  flexed-biceps ,  hundred-points  and  seedling  is contingent on a users estimated political ideal point. Users on the left are likelier to employ  victory-hand  and  seedling , while those on the right are likelier to employ  flexed-biceps  and  hundred-points . Using Ludwig Wittgenstein’s theory of language games, we argue that this points to the use of emoji for communication of both political values and affect, and to the development of a new political language game of emoji.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

We show that by augmenting such LLMs with vector embeddings from highly specialized academic sources, a conversational methodology can be made accessible to historians and other researchers in the Humanities. Concretely, we evaluate and demonstrate how LLMs have the ability of assisting researchers while they examine a customized corpora of different types of documents, including, but not exclusive to: (1). primary sources, (2). secondary sources written by experts, and (3). the combination of these two. Compared to established search interfaces for digital catalogues, such as metadata and full-text search, we evaluate the richer conversational style of LLMs on the performance of two main types of tasks: (1). question-answering, and (2). extraction and organization of data. We demonstrate that LLMs semantic retrieval and reasoning abilities on problem-specific tasks can be applied to large textual archives that have not been part of the its training data. Therefore, LLMs can be augmented with sources relevant to specific research projects, and can be queried privately by researchers.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Starting with the identification of essential structural parts of their plot based on scholarly analysis of romances, we then formalize this conceptual model.   After a description of the corpus with its 950 novels, mostly from the last 20 years, and the annotation guidelines for the selected plot elements, we automatically detect these elements using a fine-tuned German Bert (with LoRA adapters). While it is clear how to evaluate the performance of the automatic extraction of the plot elements, it is less clear how to evaluate the quality of the model in total. We apply it to two texts and compare the result to summaries of these novels based on reading them, to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the plot model in making aspects of the plot structure visible.  For the quantitative evaluation each novel is represented as a multidimensional time series data. Classifications of this data distinguish between publishers, genres and series respectively; we see the performance in this task as an indication of the quality of the model. Finally, applying the model to a larger corpus of romance novels, we detect patterns of the genre. The more modern form of the romance novel, published by the publishing house  Cora , is characterized by the importance of the physical perception and the reduction of the plot with the high and exclusive focus on the relationship of the lovers.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

However, under certain conditions, they hold significant potential for multifaceted exploration: First, through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text and its apparatus, coupled with intelligent parsing of the variant readings, it becomes possible to reconstruct comprehensive manuscript collations, which can prove invaluable for a variety of investigations, including phylogenetic analyses, redaction history studies, linguistic inquiries, and more. Second, by aligning the printed edition with manuscript images, a substantial amount of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) ground truth can be generated. This serves as valuable material for paleography, layout analysis, as well as for assessing the quality of the collation criteria adopted by the editor. The present paper focuses on the challenges mastered in the processes of the OCR, the apparatus parsing, the text reconstruction, and the alignment with the manuscript images, taking as a case study the edition of the Hebrew Bible published by Kennicott in the late eighteenth century.     %After a brief introduction (§ \\ref{introduction}) and a description of this edition (§ \\ref{kennicott}), we will provide an overview of the adopted method (§ \\ref{pipeline}), from image acquisition (§ \\ref{image_acquisition}) to the final textual reconstruction (§ \\ref{text_reconstruction}). Finally, we will conclude with an assessment of the work carried out and an outlook on potential future developments (§ \\ref{conclusion}).\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

In this paper, we propose a model of narrative revelation using the information-theoretic concept of relative entropy, which has been used in a variety of settings to understand textual similarity, along with methods in time-series analysis to model the properties of revelation over narrative time. Given a beginning state of no knowledge about a story (beyond paratextual clues) and an end state of full knowledge about a story’s contents, what are the rhythms of dissemination through which we arrive at this final state? Using a dataset of over 2,700 books of contemporary English prose, we test for various time-dependent characteristics of narrative revelation against four stylistic categories of interest: audience age level, prestige, point-of-view, and fictionality.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

We investigate the dating of images using OpenCLIP, an open-source implementation of CLIP, a multi-modal language and vision model. Our experiment consists of three steps: zero-shot classification, fine-tuning, and analysis of visual content. We use the  De Boer Scene Detection  dataset, containing 39,866 gray-scale historical press photographs from 1950 to 1999. The results show that zero-shot classification is relatively ineffective for image dating, with a bias towards predicting dates in the past. Fine-tuning OpenCLIP with a logistic classifier improves performance and eliminates the bias. Additionally, our analysis reveals that images featuring buses, cars, cats, dogs, and people are more accurately dated, suggesting the presence of temporal markers. The study highlights the potential of machine learning models like OpenCLIP in dating images and emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning for accurate temporal analysis. Future research should explore the application of these findings to color photographs and diverse datasets.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Poetry is commonly available on the web and often fits within language model context sizes.

We assess whether we can prompt current language models to retrieve existing poems, and what methods lead to the most successful retrieval.

Because most studies in LSCD only consider the semantic change of words in isolation, in this paper, we propose a new direction for the analysis of semantic shifts:  traveling word pairs . First, we introduce shift correlation to find pairs of words that semantically shift together in a similar fashion. Second, we propose word relation shift to analyze how the relationship between two words has changed over time. As a test case, we investigate the word  privacy (and related words identified by a pre-existing dictionary), as an example of a word that has shifted semantics historically and remains vibrantly explored as a concept in contemporary humanistic discourse. We report that the term  privacy  in comparison shows relatively little change initially – with correlation analysis revealing more about how key terms surrounding  privacy  have shifted in tandem, and explore nuanced changes through word pair analysis, suggesting a shift toward concreteness in particular.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Deconstruction of binary oppositions such as man/woman, black/white, left/right, and rich/poor is therefore increasingly encouraged. The question arises of what kind of effect the debate about binary oppositions has had on its linguistic use. We have therefore detected antonyms in a corpus of Dutch newspaper articles from the period 1990-2020, to study the development of binarism in journalism. Our method consists of two parts: the use of a good-old lexicon, and the finetuning of a BERT model for antonym detection. In this paper, we not only present our results regarding the (de)construction of binary oppositions in Dutch journalism, but we also reflect on the two methodological stages and discuss their gain.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Moreover, the same words can have other meanings while occurring in the sentence-final position. The tags’ felicity conditions were addressed in previous corpus-based and experimental work and attributed to semantic and pragmatic properties of tag questions. This paper addresses the question of whether and to what extent the differences among German tags can be determined automatically. We assess the performance of three pretrained German BERT models on a tag question dataset and fine-tune one of these models on the tag word prediction task. A close examination of this model’s output indicates that BERT can identify properties relevant for the tags’ felicity conditions and interchangeability consistent with previous studies.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

We evaluate the strengths and pitfalls of these methodologies by employing two datasets: one comprising ancient shipwrecks and the other ancient Greek inscriptions. While these objects can, in principle, be precisely dated to specific years, they are often assigned broader date ranges, spanning centuries or longer historical periods. We propose that the most promising approaches involve using these date ranges as defining probabilities. By randomly assigning specific dates based on these probabilities, we enable hypothesis testing for temporal trends. As we want to encourage other scholars to employ the methods we propose, we offer a detailed description of the implementation of these methods using functions from the Python  tempun  package.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

A Case Study of Animals in Children’s Literature\nAbstract: The content of literary fiction at least partly depends on literary   tradition. The dependence is attested quantitatively in the   association of genre with lexical statistical patterns.  This short   paper is a step to formal modeling of the content-moderating   processes associated with literary genres.  The idea is to explain   prevalence of the particular lemmas in a literary text by the   genre-dependent accessibility of the semantic category during the   creative process. Data on animals mentioned in various sub-genres in   a corpus of Russian children’s literature is used as an empirical   case. Vocabulary growth models are applied to infer genre-related   differences in overall diversity of animal vocabularies. A   constrained topic model is employed to infer preferences for   particular animal lemmas displayed by various genres. Results   demonstrate the models’ potential to infer genre-related content   preferences in the context of high variance and data imbalance.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Here, we propose a different approach based on the production of immaterial works (e.g. poems, philosophical treatises, musical pieces, scientific work). Immaterial works require time, energy, resources, and human capital to be produced, disseminated and appreciated, and thus indirectly reflect a wide range of economic processes. Moreover, their survival rate tends to be higher because they can be abstracted from their initial material incarnation (e.g. scrolls, manuscripts) and preserved throughout the centuries. We build a large database of cultural producers (painters, scientists, etc.) that exist in online catalogs (Library of Congress ID, GND ID, VIAF ID, Iranica ID etc) and create an estimate of immaterial production that is robust and consistent across cultures and sources. We show that immaterial production in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome is closely related to economic development, and reveals important phases of economic development. Overall, immaterial production provides new insights into the roots and the evolution of economic development in the very long run in Classical Antiquity.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

The list of possible topics is deliberately broad and inclusive – if you’re using digital tools or methods in the organisation, analysis, and visualisation of historical data we’d love to hear from you. Proposals are due on 23 February and can be submitted through the Conference website.\n\nWe’re particularly keen for HDR and ECR scholars to be involved. To help meet registration and travel costs, the ARDC is funding up to four $1000 bursaries. More details are available here. Bursary applications close on 31 March.\nThere’s also likely to be a digital history workshop, as well as updates on the work of the HASS & Indigenous Research Data Commons and ARDC Community Data Lab, including the Trove Data Guide.\nTime is short!

You can download the datasets from this GitHub repository.\nI’ve also written the codes back into the Wikidata records, so you can now find them with a SPARQL query like this.\nThe columns in the CSV file are:\ncode – MARC geographic areas code (without any trailing dashes)\nplace – name of geographic area from the MARC list\nwikidata_label – name of geographic area from Wikidata\nwikidata_id – Wikidata identifier\ncoordinates – pair of decimal coordinates in the form latitude,longitude (multiple values are pipe | separated)\niso_country_code – ISO two letter country code (multiple values are pipe | separated)\niso_numeric_country_code – ISO numeric country code (multiple values are pipe | separated)\ngeonames_id – GeoNames identifier (multiple values are pipe | separated)\nNote that some fields can contain multiple values.

          "description": "Artificial intelligence, particularly in the form of large language models, has been at the forefront of news for several years. The majority of historians, when they express an opinion on the matter, seem mainly concerned about whether their students will be able to have essays composed by an electronic servant, and if so, to whom the obtained grade should be attributed. It is true that sometimes one looks at the finger pointing towards the star and not at the moon itself. Indeed, it seems that the impact is not so much of the invention, but of the accessibility of these devices that could be significant. The acquisition of historical data, its manipulation, as well as its interpretation are expected to take place within a workshop, with deeply renewed tools. The collapse of the cost of data acquisition and manipulation opens up multiple possibilities, among which are the potential for data-driven research, the manipulation of corpora of unprecedented size, and, paradoxically, a distancing from the text, the basic element of the historian's diet since the origins of the discipline. We will explore these potentialities through a few examples.\nPhilippe Rygiel is a Senior professor at Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon.\n \n\n\nWednesday, 27 March 2024\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space (4th floor, Maison des Sciences humaines) and online.\n27 March 2024\n  Digital history & historiography\n  Artificial  intelligence  Digital hermeneutics\n  Hands-on History\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "Since the 1970s, deindustrialisation has fundamentally changed Luxembourg’s economy, shifting its focus from industry to services. Beyond these major structural changes, the restructuring of the steel industry has had important consequences at the local level, both for workers and for industrial towns. This research focuses on the impact of deindustrialisation in three industrial towns in Luxembourg, Esch, Dudelange and Pétange, and aims to explore local challenges and initiatives in response to the restructuring of the steel industry.\nThe closure of blast furnaces and rolling mills triggered intense debates in the town councils of Luxembourg's steel towns, focusing on issues such as the town budget and overall viability. Industrial decline was seen as a potential 'death blow' for the existence of the towns, leading various stakeholders, including workers, shop owners, trade unionists and politicians, to rally against the closure of the local blast furnace. A key area of interest in the research are the local strategies implemented to address the challenges of deindustrialisation and the decisions taken by the steel companies ARBED and MMR-A and the Tripartite Conference. Although the focus of the research is on the cities, the national and European levels are also taken into account, as local actions extended beyond city boundaries.\n \nWednesday, 20 March 2024\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space (4th floor, Maison des Sciences humaines)\n20 March 2024\n  Public history\n  Industrial history\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "The exhibition Minett Stories tells the history of the industrial region in the south of Luxembourg. Instead of focusing on the mining and smelting technologies, large iron works and steel barons, the project team decided to present the everyday history of an industrial region, concentrating on the time span from the industrialization of the region in around 1870 to the steel crisis of the 1970s. The online exhibition embraced the concept of transmedia storytelling for the production of narratives and media: the team worked in collaboration with several artists, stage actors and designers to produce graphic novels, interactive videos and maps, radio plays and video essays. The presentation will cover several examples to highlight this approach, before reflecting on the project as part of t…",

La professionnalisation de la diplomatie au XIXe siècle a fait de ce domaine un bastion du pouvoir masculin où l’accès des femmes ne fut qu’aléatoire et discrétionnaire. Après la Seconde Guerre mondiale, la reconnaissance par l’ONU des droits des femmes (1946) sensibilise progressivement les opinions publiques et incite les États à l’action politique. La construction européenne est rythmée par l’égalité entre les hommes et les femmes, inscrite d’abord dans les Traité de Rome (1957) et devenue, avec le Traité de Maastricht (1992), une valeur fondamentale et une priorité de l’UE, car les discriminations perdure…",

Approximately one million hectares of high biodiversity forests have been burned so far since the #AmazonFires started. Almost 20% of the Amazon rainforest has been devastated.

          "description": "What we call “technology” today involves intensely concentrated metabolic processes, ingesting and transforming energy and materials on a planetary scale. Techno-metabolism also concentrates and compresses time. Its temporalities include Earth's deep past (fossil fuels, minerals) and its present (biological net primary production). The Anthropocene epoch – with humanity as a new geological force – now appears likely to consume, as well, the human future, potentially to the extinction of our species. Holding multiple temporal and spatial scales within our analytic frameworks has proven (unsurprisingly) difficult for STS and History of Technology. This talk offers ways of reconfiguring our conceptual and methodological tools to meet this urgent challenge.\nPaul N. Edwards is Director of the Program on Science, Technology & Society at Stanford University (where he also co-directs the Stanford Existential Risks Initiative), and Professor of Information and History(Emeritus) at the University of Michigan. He is the author of A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming (MIT Press, 2010) and co-editor of Changing the Atmosphere: Expert Knowledge and Environmental Governance (MIT Press, 2001), as well as numerous articles and other books.

          "description": "The «long» 1960s in Western Europe saw a dynamic development of mass consumption, especially in the field of consumer electronics. Media artifacts, such as transistor radios, television sets, or cassette recorders all became significantly more common in Luxembourg, France, and Germany, influencing the composition of the media ensemble and opening up new ways for consumers to interact with media. In a concomitant development brought about by the new market conditions, companies producing such media artifacts – such as Braun or Telefunken – became increasingly interested in marketing, placing consumers and their desires at the center of their considerations in lieu of production.\nUsing internal company documents, advertisements and statistics as sources, this research traces how and at what scale producing companies used advertising and other marketing measures to popularize media artifacts in the «long» 1960s and how these efforts interrelated with the media ensemble.

Depending on their roles in specialist knowledge domains and society at large, heritage objects are categorized as either material or immaterial; static or dynamic; historical or contemporary in nature. For example, in societal debates, heritage needs to be fluid, debatable, even contestable, while scientists of the past seek the robustness of historical sources in order to create a valid reconstruction of aspects of the past.\nIn this workshop, we are not going to make things easier. Approaching the matter from the domain of critical heritage theory, we find that heritage is best understood as an ongoing forging and recasting of relationships.

          "description": "How did newly drawn state border lines after the First World War provoke the establishment and implementation of policies and practices of veteran welfare selection? Different understandings of veteran welfare by historical actors in the French-Luxembourgish-German-Belgian borderlands prompted unique selections of beneficiaries, which resulting in the composition of various (cross-border) mixed welfare systems. This contribution highlights the importance of thinking about bordering practices in tandem with the way time was experienced by veterans and within their environments. \nSOCIOBORD reframes the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by restoring the contributions of local actors – primarily families and associations – to shaping welfare systems in three European borderlands: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions from the late 19th century to the 1990s.

These topics have gained increased attention in the last fifteen years as the crisis of 2007/2008 renewed the discussion on inequalities and (fiscal) justice. Humanities and Social Sciences played an important role in framing debates on this topic. Wealth was perhaps less produced by manufacturing cars or building houses than by moving capital across jurisdictions, creating multi jurisdictional spaces where national states, global companies, local financial plumbers and international organisations created, maintained and governed global tax chains.\nThis workshop has a dual purpose.

Im Laufe der letzten Jahrzehnte traf diese Debatte auf eine ganze Reihe weiterer Vorschläge aus der transnationalen und Globalgeschichte, aus der Kultur- und Sozialgeschichte, aus den Diskussionen um Postkolonialismus und reciprocal comparisons. Trotzdem oder gerade deswegen ist regelmäßig wiederkehrend die Frage aufgeworfen worden, ob es sich nun um ein etabliertes Verfahren oder um einen noch immer umstrittenen und fragilen Vorschlag handele. Der Vortrag situiert diese Debatte in der Forschungsgeschichte und versucht sich an einer pragmatischen Kombination von Vergleich und Transfer.\n \nMittwoch, 15.

          "description": "For its first one hundred and fifty years, the U.S. government had relatively few secrets, and subsidized the free flow of information to ensure democratic accountability. But all that changed after Pearl Harbor, with the rise of the dark state. The last two decades have witnessed particularly dramatic growth in government secrecy, at the same time that declassification has all but collapsed. Now that so much is secret, it has become all but impossible to protect truly dangerous information. Connelly explores the policies and practices that gave rise to the current crisis, above all presidents’ determination to preserve sovereign power over “national security information.” The digital archiving methods that were supposed to stop unauthorized leaks instead gave rise to Wikileaks, and the wholesale destruction of the documentary record has made it all but impossible even for historians to hold public officials to account. But new data science methods now make it possible to systematically analyze patterns and anomalies in state secrecy, and show not only what the government did not want us to know, but why.\n \n\n\n \nMatthew Connelly is a professor of international and global history at Columbia University, and director of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. Connelly is also the principal investigator of History Lab, a project that uses data science to analyze state secrecy. His publications include A Diplomatic Revolution: Algeria's Fight for Independence and the Origins of the Post-Cold War Era, Fatal Misconception: The Struggle to Control World Population, and The Declassification Engine: What History Reveals about America’s Top Secrets. Connelly received his B.A. from Columbia in 1990 and earned his Ph.D. from Yale in 1997. \n \nWednesday, 29 November 2023\n14.00 - 15.00\nOnline\n29 November 2023\n  Archives  Data Science  Digital hermeneutics  Digital methods  Digital tools\n  Hands-on History\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Moving beyond a one case study model, this presentation adopts a regional, thematic, and historical approach to elucidate the diverse ways in which African nations have grappled with colonial statues from the time of independences. The paper begins by examining the fate of colonial statues at the time of independences, exploring why certain monuments were removed, repurposed, or preserved. Subsequently, the paper delves into the reasons for the revival of (neo)colonial statues in the 1990s and early 2000s. Finally, the paper discusses recent and renewed contestations of colonial statues from the 2010s, in the light of global movements against symbols of oppression.

Museums are forged in a ‘cunning’ liberal constitutional structure (Povinelli 2002): to conserve for future generations; to make collections accessible to everyone now; to represent the world; to shape the world. Ideals so big they can never be achieved, creating a constitutive deficit.

The aim of these initiatives was to collect the 'ordinary' memory of the event and thus help to build a collective memory that reflected a diversity of experiences.

These administrative forms contain information on the population movements in and out of the city. These are being scanned and transcribed.\nFor the transcription, the project uses Transkribus to restitute not only the textual content of these administrative forms but also their structure, e.g., for each field, a tag is attached. Secondly, for the blocs of texts, a script to detect place and time information is being developed internally. All these steps should lead up to the structuration before import of the data to be visualised on a map and open these rich collections for further analysis, on the history of migration, housing, public health etc.\nWe invite all interested persons to join the discussion on how to improve this pipeline and share other potential uses for the extracted material.\n \nWednesday, 18 October 2023\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space\n18 October 2023\n  Digital history & historiography\n  Archives  Data Science  Digital methods  Digital tools  Digitisation  Visualisation\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Our aim was twofold: coordinating a special issue and identifying “a network of colleagues, across the two fields, who are interested in the development of co-conceived case studies and research programs”.\nTo discuss the making of the informal network, we are organising on 27 September at the University of Luxembourg, Belval campus, a workshop that will be divided into two parts: the morning will be devoted to the formation of this informal network and short presentations of each other works, and the afternoon to a sort of ‘datathon’ on sources and methods we could use to explore the links between AI and collective memory.\n \nWednesday, 27 September 2023\nHybrid event\nPlease contact frederic.clavert@uni.lu if you wish to participate online or on-site.\n27 September 2023\n  Digital history & historiography\n  Artificial  intelligence  Memory studies\n  Workshop\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

In Luxemburg haben zahlreiche Menschen persönliche Erinnerungen an Besuche und Erlebnisse auf diesem Jahrmarkt, und es wird vielfach über seine historische Bedeutung geschrieben, dessen Ursprünge bis ins Jahr 1340 zurückreichen.\nEine interdisziplinäre Studie im Rahmen des Popkult60-Projekts, will die Geschichte der Schueberfouer in den langen 1960er vertiefen und die nationalen, transregionalen und transnationalen Verflechtungen und die Veränderungen dieser populären Veranstaltung aufzeigen.\nWährend ihres Vortrags wird die Doktorandin Véronique Faber den Ansatz ihrer Forschungsarbeit erläutern, und das Publikum in die 1960er Jahre einladen, eine Schueberfouer zu besuchen, die mit anderen Attraktionen aufwartete als diejenigen, die uns heute vertraut sind.\n \nMontag, 16.

The ambitious project, which aims to foster the uptake of Open Science in Europe by developing long-term interdisciplinary FAIR data services and working practices, will take place over the next four years. \nMany world-class European research infrastructures (RIs) are organised into one of the five major Science Clusters (Humanities and Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Photon and Neutron Science, Astronomy, Nuclear and Particle Physics). In the past four years, the Science Clusters have worked towards making open data easily accessible to both researchers and the public, by promoting scientific data management for enabling Open Science.\nAs a result, the five Science Clusters are an integral part of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) initiative and will further contribute to its development and implementation process through their participation in OSCARS.\nCLARIN is proud to be participating in OSCARS as part of the SSHOC cluster. CLARIN is one of three research infrastructures from the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) area to represent the Cluster, together with DARIAH ERIC and CESSDA. Our involvement ensures that the SSH community is included in the project’s developments.   \nTo maintain the high momentum achieved during the Horizon 2020 programme, OSCARS has been granted ~25M EUR funding in the framework of the European Commission Horizon Europe call HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-01, under grant agreement no. 101129751, and will be implemented in the next four years.\nFor more information, visit the OSCARS project page.\n\n      Karina Berger\n 25 January 2024",

He published widely on mediaeval philology, transcription, OCR, \n    \nText Encoding Initiative\nSee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative\nRune became very engaged in CLARIN activities. With others, he gave CLARINO courses on language data management, produced a series of instructional videos on how to use CLARINO data and services, and kept the CLARINO Bergen Centre running. He was co-author of a chapter in the 2022 CLARIN book.\nWe will miss Rune not only because he was always interested, helpful and dedicated, but also because he did so with a smile and a genuine modesty and friendliness.\nWritten by Koenraad de Smedt\n\n      Christine Dijkstra\n 9 January 2024",

The aim was to bring together the CLARIN community and national and academic libraries to present and discuss content delivery systems for researchers. The motivation for the workshop was the sense that various, mostly national, projects were disconnected from each other and also disconnected from research infrastructures such as CLARIN. The workshop resulted in a mailing list, blog post, keynote and a panel discussion at the 2022 CLARIN Annual Conference, two poster presentations, the CENL Dialogue Forum ‘National libraries as data’ and, finally, the plan to organise a second iteration of CLARIN and Libraries, to be hosted in Norway.\nC…",

CLARIN promotes interoperability by endorsing the adoption of open science standards. There is, however, a more intuitive notion of interoperability that involves language resources: be they corpora or lexicons, language resources are all made of a basic ingredient, i.e. words.

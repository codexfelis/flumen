As a result, we have had early view into a rapidly evolving service that aims to advance text analytics pedagogy. While pedagogy is its main thrust at the moment, Constellate is a fairly complex offering that is structured around three “pillars”: data, pedagogy, and research.

A webpage is built with HTML, via hypertext markup language. It pulls together text, images, and other multimedia into a single view. In the same way, a IIIF object is built using JSON, and links together metadata and powerful image capabilities which allow institutions to deliver ultra-high resolution images quickly and efficiently to a IIIF viewer. Any image (and even audio and video) can become a IIIF object by building a manifest that uses the IIIF standard to describe its",

Two years later, it's time for another ACH write-up, with a very different point of comparison: !!Con, a tech conference celebrating \"the joy, excitement, and surprise of computing\". While I've attended and presented at other virtual events this year (including the CSDH-SCHN conference), as co-VP of ACH I was particularly committed to attending as much of that conference as I could, and volunteering as a chair, online respondent, and livetweeter. !!Con was a more serendipitous discovery thanks to a tweet from Scott Weingart.

It doesn’t have to be about published research, but may also be about ongoing research or about something you’ve learned, a particular technique, or an interesting software package, a visualization technique, or whatever you can think of.\nIn short, it doesn’t have to be big. If you are hesitant to tell something about X, it’s probably a very good idea to tell something about it! Don’t think that everyone already knows about it (it is very likely that they don’t), that you not expert enough (you undoubtedly know a lot more about it than most), or that your idea is not interesting (it’s probably better than you think).\nPresentations may be up to 4 minutes in length.

          "description": "When comparing topics between LDA models trained on different collections of text, it’s common for people to use the Jensen-Shannon divergence as a measure of the (dis)similarity between topics. However, this is complicated a bit if the two collections being compared have differences in their vocabularies (i.e., some word types may be present in one collection, but not the other).\nFor example, if collection 1 has vocabulary {a, b, c} and collection 2 has vocabulary {b, c, d}, then comparisons between topics trained on the different collections require a to be inserted into the topics from collection 2, and d to be inserted into the topics learned from collection 1. My guess is that most people just insert such words with probability of 0, but I haven’t been able to find a case where this is actually addressed in the paper.\nI’m trying to think through the implications of how this issue might be handled and am looking for literature that addresses this in any way.

          "description": "And kind of upset. I thought the reviews were rather harsh. They seemed to misunderstand and downplay the humanistic payoff of the paper, instead discounting the piece for not following a (IMO stale) intro-methods-results-conclusion rubric, with heavy citation to related methods, as if I were only developing new tools rather than deriving new historical insights from them. I’m not familiar with this event but I thought this was more computational humanities than computational social science or computer science. What disciplinary backgrounds do the reviewers hail from?\nCongratulations, though, to those accepted, and thanks to the organisers for putting this together. Sorry for being a bit petty: I’ve just been rejected from ADHO a few times now, I think for being a bit too pitched to a computational-heavy audience, and now rejected from CHR, for being a bit too pitched to a humanistic audience, and wondering where my work even belongs anymore. But I will work to improve the piece and submit elsewhere.\n8 posts - 5 participants\nRead full topic",

          "description": "I know the Computer Vision for/with Humanities (data) community isn’t that well represented yet at CHR, and when reading the CFP I realised one way that might attract more publications from CV might be to adapt the short paper guideline. The main CV conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV) all follow the same policy with regards to dual/double submission (CMT submissions Website | CVPR 2021) which is typically followed by other CV conferences such as BMVC.\nThis policy doesn’t allow submission with substantial overlap; where substantial is defined as 20% or more, which is quite restrictive. But the policy also offers the great option in that papers of 4 pages or less are not considered publications, i.e.: “A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined to be a written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, was accepted.”. Explicitly accommodating this policy would make it more appealing for CV researchers that have a DH/CH leaning to submit to CHR, as it doesn’t involve choosing between venues.\nI’m aware that the CFP defines short papers as ‘up to 3000 words (ca. 6 pages references, abstract and tables/illustrations excluded)’, so in theory one could submit a short paper of <= 4 pages. But 4 pages including abstract & tables/figures is a lot shorter than the current ‘short paper’, and might require a different reviewing approach.\nA different submission type, or shortening the short paper, would in my view make CHR more attractive for CV people. Although I understand this might go against the aim of attracting original research and to be a home for research that doesn’t fit elsewhere! Happy to hear thoughts on this.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

For each game walkthrough, we provide frequencies of unigrams and bigrams, treating the walkthrough document as a Bag of Words. In addition, we provide word frequencies at the sentence level. Furthermore, the GWTC contains a number of game-related metadata, including title, publisher, developer, year, and genre. All the language statistics and metadata are stored in separate plain text files and can be referenced through uniform resource names (URN). These URNs can also be used to derive any combination of statistics and metadata. Researchers, for instance, can investigate the most frequent unigrams for games in the “Adventure” genre. This way, the GWTC can be reused for different kinds of research questions on gaming language.\n Published on 2021-07-14 11:25:20",

          "description": "Existing text recognition engines enables to train general models to recognize not only one specific hand but a multitude of historical hands within a particular script, and from a rather large time period (more than 100 years). This paper compares different text recognition engines and their performance on a test set independent of the training and validation sets. We argue that both, test set and ground truth, should be made available by researchers as part of a shared task to allow for the comparison of engines. This will give insight into the range of possible options for institutions in need of recognition models. As a test set, we provide a data set consisting of 2,426 lines which have been randomly selected from meeting minutes of the Swiss Federal Council from 1848 to 1903. To our knowledge, neither the aforementioned text lines, which we take as ground truth, nor the multitude of different hands within this corpus have ever been used to train handwritten text recognition models. In addition, the data set used is perfect for making comparisons involving recognition engines and large training sets due to its variability and the time frame it spans. Consequently, this paper argues that both the tested engines, HTR+ and PyLaia, can handle large training sets. The resulting models have yielded very good results on a test set consisting of unknown but stylistically similar hands.\n Published on 2021-07-09 10:49:34",

The language model architectures include word type embeddings (word2vec and fastText) and contextualized models (BERT and Flair). For each architecture, we trained a model instance using the whole dataset. Additionally, we trained separate instances on text published before 1850 for the type embeddings, and four instances considering different time slices for BERT. Our models have already been used in various downstream tasks where they consistently improved performance.

Moreover, we discuss a well-defined end-to-end process that has been streamlined and optimised to produce high-quality open text data based on parliamentary documents. Based on the above methodology, a representative sample of 2,000 questions from four parliamentary periods in the Hellenic Parliament has been extracted, validated, and placed into an open data repository. Furthermore, open data production is analysed, and several degrees of freedom in its application in alternative data sets are proposed and discussed. Consequently, the authors argue that this method constitutes a transferable and scalable practice that can be used by other representative institutions for the creation and subsequent study of their open data.\n Published on 2021-08-04 11:00:17",

          "description": "In this paper, we discuss how different types of automatic annotation of digitised newspaper articles can be integrated into the iterative questioning of the source material and the creation of research corpora out of a collection of unstructured texts (kept in a structured collection). We annotate a sizeable collection of Swiss press articles (183,270), extracted via the impresso interface1 using topic modelling (MALLET)2 as well as a naïve Bayes classifier (script by Milan van Lange).\nThe methodological discussion we propose is to explore how text mining can help identify historical discourses that are difficult to query with keywords because of their inherent ambiguity and how to grasp them in a large corpus. We argue that the automated annotations can provide a body of corroborating evidence of the searched discourse, to be used as an intermediary and heuristic analysis step.\n Published on 2021-09-17 11:39:06",

It is enriched with annotations of named entities of the types PERSON, LOCATION, and ORGANIZATION. The annotation was done automatically for the whole collection where two researchers annotated a portion of it manually for evaluation purposes. In this dataset, we provide the tagged texts, the lists of extracted entities, and frequency counts. The corpus is useful for historians, allowing, for instance, comparative analyses between parishes and regions or to calculate the area of influence of a locality. The paper describes the creation and evaluation of the corpus, discusses its applications and limitations.

          "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the obvious implications for public health and the economy at a global scale, has also had significant social and cultural effects: the partial or complete lockdown of public life breaks social and cultural networks and habits, and necessitates the invention of new forms of communication, contact, and inspiration. Over the course of the pandemic, various initiatives have emerged that have tried to capture this unique moment in history by collecting documentation on the social and cultural impact of the pandemic on people’s daily lives. Most of these collections were created bottom-up, either by actively approaching individuals or communities to contribute or be interviewed, or by opening platforms where citizens could directly contribute documentation. In this paper, we analyse two such citizen-generated collections of experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic: the ‘Corona in the City’ collection, assembled by the Amsterdam Museum for an online exhibition with the same title, and the ‘Dagboek Corona’ (Corona Diary) collection of diary contributions, assembled by the Dutch public historian and journalist José Boon. The paper discusses the background of these citizen-generated COVID-19 collections, assessing their scope and accessibility, and presenting a first, qualitative analysis of their content. We conclude with a reflection on the implications of the findings for people’s social life and identity, indicating how the datasets can be explored in further research and how the findings may benefit effective policy making.\n Published on 2021-07-21 12:09:35",

          "description": "Introduction: in this study, Cebral Loureda analyzes how will and desire are conveyed in: Ethics, by Spinoza; The Phenomenology of Spirit, by Hegel; The World as Will and Representation, by Schopenhauer; and Thus spoke Zarathustra, by Nietzsche. With the idea of determining theses texts’ degree of cohesion, the author follows a computational and quantitative methodology to compare and contrast them, as well as assess their internal contradictions. A normalized corpus, statistics and visualizations are employed so as to evaluate the terminology, topoi and sentimentality of these works.  In relation to terminology, author’s findings revealed that Nietzsche uses a highly differentiated vocabulary from that of the other philosophers, adding marked emotional connotations to his discourse. Visualizations showed the terminological commonalities between Hegel and Schopenhauer and shed light on the former bearing the highest number of semantic connections with the other philosophers.  As for topoi, results showed there is a clear dichotomic tension between conceptual and vital experience in the studied documents. Redefining this dualism, however, Cebral Loureda observed that the concrete is always intertwined with the abstract and vice versa.  Regarding the sentimental dimension of these works, examination unveiled that Nietzsche’s presents the greatest negative sentimental load. In contrast, Spinoza’s is the most emotionally balanced. With all this, Cebral Loureda proves that there is a high degree of cohesion among these philosophical works, which link reason and emotion to will, time and spirit, core notions of modern philosophy and society.",

In this case, the significance of 1st of May in German literature (as reflected in the \"Corpus of German-Language Fiction\" dataset) was determined with the help of a freely accessible data set and the open access tool HeidelTime. The brief description of the workflow is a smart demonstration of the potential of open DH methods and data sharing in sustainable ways.\n\nBonus one: the post starts out from briefly touching upon some of Frank's public humanities activities.\n\nBonus two: mention of the Tiwoli (“Today in World Literature”) app, a fun side product built on to pof the date extraction research.",

Do you want to know every detail about a ‘Double-gourd Vase I’? If you consult ‘Class’ in the ‘Ontology’ section (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/class.html), you can discover the component, the function, from what such a vessel is made of, and what is the method to fire it. If you also wish to see how the vase appears, under ‘Individuals’ of the same section you can read a full description of it and, also, see a picture (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/class.html).

Based on a documentary corpus connected to the 2013 book by Alfred Reisch, which documented efforts by the CIA to disseminate books in the Soviet Bloc in the period 1956-1971, the authors use the Tableau Public platform to re-assess information science methods for researching historical events. Their analysis suggests that books distributed did not tend to have a more obvious political slant, but were more likely to have a broader universalist outlook. While it skirts around some of the limitations of visualization (highlighted elsewhere by Drucker and others) it offers a solid introduction to the benefits of a data-driven approach to a general audience.",

          "description": "Introduction: In this paper, Ehrlicher et al. follow a quantitative approach to unveil possible structural parallelisms between 13 comedies and 10 autos sacramentales written by Calderón de la Barca. Comedies are analyzed within a comparative framework, setting them against Spanish comedia nueva and French comedie precepts. Authors employ tool DramaAnalysis and statistics for their examination, focusing on: word frequency per subgenre, average number of characters, their variation and discourse distribution, etc. Autos sacramentales are also evaluated through these indicators. Regarding comedies, Ehrlicher et al.’s results show that Calderón: a) plays with units of space and time depending on creative and dramatic needs, b) does not follow French comedie conventions of character intervention or linkage, but c) does abide by its concept of structural symmetry. As for autos sacramentales, their findings brought forth that these have a similar length and character variation to comedies. However, they also identified the next difference: Calderón uses character co-presence in them to reinforce the message conveyed. Considering all this, authors confirm that Calderón’s comedies disassociate from classical notions of theatre – both Aristotelian and French –ideals. With respect to autos sacramentales, they believe further evaluation would be needed to verify ideas put forward and identify other structural patterns.",

This book chapter describes a web-based tool called CATMA which  promises a \"low-threshold\" approach to digitally encoded text interpretation. CATMA has a long trajectory based on a 'standoff' approach to markup, somewhat provocatively described by its creators as \"undogmatic\", which stands in contrast to more established systems for text representation in digital scholarly editing and publishing such as XML markup, or the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Standoff markup involves applying numbers to each character of a text and then using those numbers as identifiers to store interpretation externally. This approach allows for \"multip…",

But how do you find out what issues are available? How do you get a list of dates when newspapers were published? This notebook in the GLAM Workbench shows how you can get information about issues from the Trove API.\nUsing the notebook, I’ve created a couple of datasets ready for download and use.\nTotal number of issues per year for every newspaper in Trove\nHarvested 10 October 2021\nCSV formatted dataset containing the number of newspaper issues available on Trove, totalled by title and year – comprises 27,604 rows with the fields:\ntitle – newspaper title\ntitle_id – newspaper id\nstate – place of publication\nyear – year published\nissues – number of issues\nDownload from Cloudstor: newspaper_issues_totals_by_year_20211010.csv (2.1mb)\nComplete list of issues for every newspaper in Trove\nHarvested 10 October 2021\nCSV formatted dataset containing a complete list of newspaper issues available on Trove – comprises 2,654,020 rows with the fields:\ntitle – newspaper title\ntitle_id – newspaper id\nstate – place of publication\nissue_id – issue identifier\nissue_date – date of publication (YYYY-MM-DD)\nTo keep the file size down, I haven’t included an issue_url in this dataset, but these are easily generated from the issue_id. Just add the issue_id to the end of http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue. For example: http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue495426. Note that when you follow an issue url, you actually get redirected to the url of the first page in the issue.\nDownload from Cloudstor: newspaper_issues_20211010.csv (222mb)\nFor more information see the Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench.",

          "description": "Way back in 2013, I went to the eResearch Australasia conference as the manager of Trove to talk about new research possibilities using the Trove API. Eight years years later I was back, still spruiking the possibilities of Trove data. This time, however, I was discussing Trove in the broader context of GLAM data – all the exciting possibilities that have emerged as galleries, libraries, archives and museums make more of their collections available in machine-readable form. The big question is, of course, how do researchers, particularly those in the humanities, make use of that data? The GLAM Workbench is my attempt to address that question – to provide humanities researchers with both the tools and information they need, and an understanding of the possibilities that might emerge if they invest a bit of time in working with GLAM data. My eResearch Australasia 2021 presentation provides a quick introduction to the GLAM Workbench, here’s the video, and the slides.\n\n\nA GLAM Workbench for humanities researchers from Tim Sherratt on Vimeo.\n\n\nThe presentation was pre-recorded, but I managed to sneak in an update via chat for those who attended the session.

The image download option produces an HTML page with embedded images, and the article is often sliced into pieces to fit the page.\nThis Python package includes tools to download articles as complete JPEG images. If an article is printed across multiple newspaper pages, multiple images will be downloaded – one for each page. It’s intended for integration into other tools and processing workflows, or for people who like working on the command line.\nYou can use it as a library:\nfrom trove_newspaper_images.articles import download_images\n\nimages = download_images('107024751')\n\nOr from the command line:\ntrove_newspaper_images.download 107024751 --output_dir images\n\nIf you just want to quickly download an article as an image without installing anything, you can use this web app in the GLAM Workbench. To download images of all articles returned by a search in Trove, you can also use the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester.\nSee the documentation for more information. #dhhacks",

I’ve published the full lists of books and periodicals as searchable databases to make them easy to explore.\n\nOne thing that you might notice is that works with the format ‘Government publication’ pop up in both lists – sometimes it’s not clear whether something is a ‘book’ or ‘periodical’. To make it easier to find these items, no matter what their format, I’ve combined data from my two harvests and created a searchable dataset of government publications. It includes links to download OCRd text from CloudStor if available.\nAll three databases make use of Datasette, which I’ve also used for the GLAM Name Index Search.

There’s freshly-harvested data, as well as updated Python packages, integration with Reclaim Cloud, and automated Docker builds.\nIncluded is a notebook to harvest details of all books available from Trove in digital form. This includes both digitised books, that have been scanned and OCRd, as well as born digital publications, such as PDFs and epubs. The definition of ‘books’ is pretty loose – I’ve harvested details of anything that has been assigned the format ‘Book’ in Trove, but this includes ephemera, such as posters, pamphlets, and advertising.\nIn the latest harvest, I ended up with details of 42,174 ‘books’. This includes some duplicates, because multiple metadata entries can point to the same digital object. I thought it was best to preserve the duplicates, rather than discard the metadata.\nOnce I’d harvested the details of the books, I tried to see if there was any OCRd text available for download. If there was, I saved it to a public folder on CloudStor. In total, I was able to download 26,762 files of OCRd text.\n\nThe easiest way to explore the books is using this searchable database. It’s created using Datasette and is running on Glitch. Full text search is available on the ‘title’ and ‘contributors’ fields, and you can filter on things like date, copyright status, number of pages, and whether OCRd text is available for download. If there is OCRd text, a direct link to the file on CloudStor is included. You can use the database to filter the titles, creating your own dataset that you can download in CSV or JSON format.\nIf you just want the full list of books as a CSV file, you can download it here. And if you want all the OCRd text, you can go straight to the public folder on CloudStor – there’s about 3.6gb of text files to explore! #dhhacks",

But amongst the items catalogued as ‘books’ are a wide assortment of ephemera, posters, advertisements, and other oddities. There’s no consistent way of identifying these items through the search interface, but because I’ve found the number of pages in each ‘book’ as part of the harvesting process, I can limit results to items with just a single digitised page – there’s more than 1,500! To make it easy to explore this collection of odds and ends, I’ve downloaded all the single page images and compiled them into one big PDF with links back to their entries in Trove. Enjoy your browsing!\n\nThis is another example of the ways in which we can extend and enrich existing collection interfaces using simple technologies like PDFs and CSVs. We can create slices across existing categories to expose interesting features, and provide new entry points for researchers. Some other examples in the GLAM Workbench are the collection of editorial cartoons from The Bulletin, the list of Trove newspapers with non-English content, the harvest of ABC Radio National programs, and the recent collection of politicians talking about COVID.

You’ll notice that the list includes a large number of parliamentary papers and government reports as well as published journals.\n\nAll of the harvested text is available from a public folder on CloudStor.\nThe harvesting process involves a few different steps:\nFirst I generate a list of periodicals available in digital form from Trove. This includes digitised titles, as well as born-digital titles submitted through e-Legal Deposit. This produced a CSV file containing the details of 7,270 titles. See this notebook for details.\nThen I work through this list of titles to find out how many issues of each title are available through Trove. This information isn’t accessible through the API, so I have to do some screen scraping.\nNext I work through the list of issues and try to download the text contents. Most of the born-digital titles don’t have downloadable text.\nOnce I’ve downloaded all the text I can from a title, I create a CSV file for it that lists the available issues and notes whether text is available for each.

And it’s open access!\nThe article is ‘Missing Links: Data Stories from the Archive of British Settler Colonial Citizenship’. In it we document our efforts to assemble a number of different datasets relating to naturalization. Here’s the abstract:\nDigitized sources and digital methods are changing the way that we do history. For historians of the British Empire, the digital age offers new possibilities for investigating the lives of those who moved around the empire and across the world. However, much discussion of the possibilities and problems of digital history have focused on the creation and use of full text resources, skipping over the analytical opportunities offered by the descriptive systems in which those texts are embedded. This article is an attempt to fill this gap by documenting a journey through archival data relating to nineteenth-century Chinese naturalization in the Pacific Rim settler colonies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. We argue that such data stories are critical if we are to understand both possibilities and pitfalls of research in digital collections.\nThere’s also an GitHub repository with code and data related to the article.",

This means you can take advantage of Trove’s advanced search and facets to build complex queries.\nMultiple time scales – previous versions only aggregated search results by year, but now you can also aggregate by month, or by day. QueryPic will automatically choose a time unit based on the date range of your query, but if you’re not happy with the result you can change it!\nLinks back to Trove – click on any of the points on the chart to search Trove within that time period. This enables you to zoom in and out of your results, from the high-level visualisation, to individual articles.\n\nThis version of QueryPic is built within a Jupyter notebook, and designed to run using Voila (which hides all the code and makes the notebook look like a web app). See the Trove Newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench for more information. If you’d like to give it a try, just click the button below to run it live using Binder.\n\nHope you find it useful! #dhhacks",

My fellow panellists described some amazing stuff going on in European cultural heritage organisations to support researchers who want to make use of web archives. My ‘lab’ doesn’t have a physical presence, or an institutional home, but it does provide a starting point for researchers, and with the latest Reclaim Cloud and Docker integrations, everyone can have their own web archives lab!

          "description": "When the 1-click installer for Reclaim Cloud works its magic and turns GLAM Workbench repositories into your own, personal digital labs, it creates a new work directory mounted inside of your main Jupyter directory. This new directory is independent of the Docker image used to run Jupyter, so it’s a handy place to copy things if you ever want to update the Docker image. However, I just realised that there was a permissions problem with the work directory which meant you couldn’t write files to it from within Jupyter.\nTo fix the problem, I’ve added an extra line to the reclaim-manifest.jps config file to make the Jupyter user the owner of the work directory:\n\t- cmd[cp]: chown -R jovyan:jovyan /home/jovyan/work\n\nThis takes care of any new installations. If you have an existing installation, you can either just create a completely new environment using the updated config, or you can manually change the permissions:\nHover over the name of your environment in the control panel to display the option buttons.\nClick on the Settings button. A new box will open at the bottom of the control panel with all the settings options.\nClick on ‘SSH Access’ in the left hand menu of the settings box.\nClick on the ‘SSH Connection’ tab.\nUnder ‘Web SSH’ click on the Connect button and select the default node.\nA terminal session will open. At the command line enter the following:\n\tchown -R jovyan:jovyan /home/jovyan/work\n\n\n\n\nDone! See the Using Reclaim Cloud section of the GLAM Workbench for more information.",

          "description": "I’ve been working on an essay for publication in a forthcoming edited collection. I wanted to explore how the practice of history in Australia had been changed by GLAM organisations making their collections available online – both the new possibilities that had emerged, and the problems that remained. In the end I focused on three areas – discovery, digitisation, and research infrastructure. If you’re interested, I’ve shared a preprint on Zenodo.\nHere’s a taste:\nJust twenty years ago, historical research often entailed long hours spent at a microfilm reader, browsing newspaper after newspaper in the hope of finding something relevant. The changes wrought by Trove, and other digital collections, seem revolutionary, but as with all revolutions there have been gains and losses. Alongside the wonders wrought by digitisation, this chapter has tried to highlight some of the paths not taken. The online resources we now use daily are not simply the products of technology – priorities have been set, funding has been distributed, decisions made about what to include and what to leave out. Cultural heritage collections are not just put online, they are placed within specific contexts of discovery and use. Each object, each version, each interface comes with a set of limitations and affordances that together determine what is possible. We do not know yet how these decisions will shape the sorts of histories that we write.\nI enjoyed reminding myself about some early digital initiatives in the GLAM sector, but as is usual with these sorts of projects, I had to leave a lot out. It’s made me think about developing a larger project documenting our gains and losses.",

It simply takes a search url from Trove’s Newspapers & Gazettes category and converts it into a set of parameters that you can use to request data from the Trove API. While some parameters are used both in the web interface and the API, there are a lot of variations – this package means you don’t have to keep track of all the differences!\nIt’s very simple to use.\n\nThe code for the parser has been basically lifted from the Trove Newspaper Harvester. I wanted to separate it out so that I could use it at various spots in the GLAM Workbench and in other projects.\nThis package, the documentation, and the tests were all created using nbdev, which is really quite a fun way to develop Python packages. #dhhacks",

It posits that industrialisation provided an aesthetic canvas for literary modernism and illustrates the ways in which the writer and journalist Batty Weber and his contemporaries sought to modernise a dominant ideological attachment to the soil by instituting the sky as the never-fixed embodiment of ideational change. In the arts, industry as a subject was mainly taken up by avant-garde writers, who constructed the industrial light spectacle and billowing smokes as symbols of intellectual progress and supranational cosmopolitan exchange.

          "description": "The reporting on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961 is considered one of the first international media events. At the same time, the trial marked a turning point in society's examination of the Holocaust and was very much in the spirit of the Cold War.

          "description": "During the last two decades, scholars have increasingly stressed the importance of culture in the history of European integration. Studies have unpacked the European Union’s attempts to sell the European project to audiences in the Member States and abroad, yet little is known about the role exhibitions played in this process. Developing stands and pavilions for regional, national and international exhibitions formed a significant strategy within the European cultural politics complex. My PhD thesis looks at the participation of the EU in the international exhibitions that hold the largest political and symbolic importance: World Expos.\nIn her thesis Anastasia Remes selects four pavilions as case studies: the European Coal and Steel Community pavilion in Brussels in 1958, the European Communities pavilion in Montreal in 1967, the European Community pavilion in Seville in 1992 and the EU pavilion in Shanghai in 2010. In this presentation, I will discuss how the European pavilions presented the EU at the various World Expos. I will expand on the three research questions that have driven my research: to what extent is the EU presented as a state, how is the EU’s global power constructed and how did the EU transform its message in engaging pavilions and exhibitions?\n \nTuesday, 21 September 2021, starting at 17.00\nOnline\nfor the Webex link please contact Adelina Stefan at oana.stefan@uni.lu\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/europe_seminar_remes21_septe_mber.jpg?itok=xB3flKaS\n  'Europe' seminar with Anastasia Remes, European University Institute\n  21 September 2021\n  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Cultural policies  European integration\n  Conferences\n  Published  \nColor photograph of the European Coal and Steel Community Pavilion at Expo 58, Unknown author, 1958, CEAB12-531, p.94, Historical Archives of the European Union, Florence, Italy.",

          "description": "Over the past fifteen years, maintenance and repair practices have gained increasing academic attention, but the literature in the fields of history and philosophy of technology, science and technology studies, sociology and anthropology of technology is still focused on invention and newness. Complementing recent calls for a history of technology-in-use (D. Edgerton), broken-world thinking (S. Jackson) and a history of technology “after innovation” (A. Russell & L. Vinsel), we are working on the first systematic historical investigation of repair and maintenance in a Western consumer society.\nIn the spirit of chasing this turn, we have invited international scholars to present their own take on the histories of maintenance and repair.

After the German invasion of its western neighbours, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg in 1940, the border regions reaching from Eastern Belgium over Luxembourg to Alsace-Lorraine were seen by the Third Reich as lost German territories that needed reintegration into the Reich. One part of that reintegration policy was recruiting the local female and male youth into German labour services and armed forces.\nThis workshop will present the recruitments in each of these areas and focus on their historical similarities and differences. Further,  it will analyse the etymology and the legal aspect of the different terms describing the recruits. The workshop’s emphasis is on the quantitative analysi…",

Environmental History of the Saar-region in the 19th-century. In Imperial Germany, the industrial region along the Saar-River was the third most important of its kind. Surprisingly, there are not many papers to be found about its environmental history, despite an abundance of source material. The lecture will focus on the relatively new field of environmental justice and present case studies of environmental conflicts.\nMarkus Lay is office manager of Saarland’s historical commission and was fellow of the Hans-Blöcker-Foundation. His dissertational work focuses on the environmental history of the region during industrialisation. The “work-in-progress” is planned to be presented on umweltgeschichte.net as a Digital Public History project.

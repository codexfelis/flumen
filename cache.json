I will give an overview of the data-intensive research methodology and discuss how methods, results, and data relate to each other and must be evaluated as parts of a whole: there is no such thing as a good method, nor is there a way to know if the results are good, without considering the data. I will discuss results as a window from which we can see our data, and how we can reason about the results of digital methods. I will also present the Change is Key! research program and describe our efforts to connect computational research with research questions from the humanities and social sciences.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Generations of scholars have proposed different theories explaining this expansion, which range from functionalist explanations, focusing on the provision of public goods, to conflict theories, emphasizing the role of class struggle or warfare. To quantitatively test these theories, I develop a general dynamical model, based on the theoretical framework of cultural macroevolution. Using this model and Seshat: Global History Databank I test 17 potential predictor variables proxying mechanisms suggested by major theories of sociopolitical complexity (and >100,000 combinations of these predictors). The best-fitting model indicates a strong causal role played by a combination of increasing agricultural productivity and invention/adoption of military technologies (most notably, iron weapons and cavalry in the first millennium BCE).\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

As language modeling has become more popular in the field of digital humanities as well, it has become apparent that this hurdle exactly can be very high for researchers to be able to make use of traditional language modeling methods. This contribution demonstrates how to improve the semantic quality of pre-trained word embeddings that have been built using a smaller English text corpus by incorporating structured knowledge (synonyms, antonyms, and hypernyms). Using the state-of-the-art method GLEN (Generalized Lexical ENtailment model, Glavaš and Vulić 2019), the experiment shows mixed results: While semantic similarity and lexical entailment show improvements, the performance for semantic relatedness falls behind in this setting. However, limiting the training data to only synonyms improves semantic relatedness as well, which implies that using more but diverse training data is not always advisable when wanting to improve the semantic quality of a smaller word embedding model, as this goal merges a variety of semantic aspects.\n Link to poster\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

However, with the help of computational techniques, words can be converted to numerical data and certain parts of a text can be examined on a large scale. Textual elements such as sentence length, word length and lexical diversity, which are associated by scholars on the one hand with the writing style of an individual author and on the other with the complexity of a text and the intended age of its readers, can thus be subjected to statistical evaluation. In this paper, data from little under 700 English and Dutch books written for different ages is analysed using a statistical linear mixed model. The results show that the textual elements studied are better qualified to detect the age of the intended reader of a text than the identity or age of the author.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Rising interest in the book, amplified by the success of the recent screen adaptation, has aroused curiosity regarding its realization. We use Rolling Delta and Rolling Classify to detect stylistic signals from each author as these methods reveal authorial takeovers. The same techniques are applied to compare the screenplay of the show to the novel. The results indicate that  Good Omens  resembles Pratchett’s work more closely. The screenplay is correctly attributed to Gaiman, its sole author, and the comparison reveals that Gaiman may have relied less on the source material over the course of the narrative arc.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Rather than computing relative frequencies as the number of occurrences of a given word divided by the total number of tokens in a text, I argue that a more efficient normalization factor is the total number of  relevant  tokens only. The notion of relevant words includes synonyms and, usually, a few dozen other words in some ways semantically similar to a word in question. To determine such a semantic background, one of word embedding models can be used. The proposed method outperforms classical most-frequent-word approaches substantially, usually by a few percentage points depending on the input settings.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Accordingly, a lot of research has been dedicated to the documentation of tools as well as to the analysis of their impact from an epistemological perspective. In this paper we propose a binary and a multi-class classification approach to detect and classify tools. The approach builds on state-of-the-art neural language models. We test our model on two different corpora and report the results for different parameter configurations in two consecutive experiments. In the end, we demonstrate how the models can be used for actual tool detection and tool classification tasks in a large corpus of DH journals.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

The basic   unit are scenes and the motif repertoire instantiated in the scene. The motif repertoire   consists of three sets of (closely related) elements: character stereotypes, types of   verbal actions and action types. It is assumed that the motif repertoire is highly   dependent on the corpus which is analyzed, in our case a corpus of romance and horror   novels published as pulp fiction. The resulting information is represented in a temporal   graph which in turn is used to compute relevant information on the scenes and   characters. Scenes are also characterized by their valence and their arousal value. A second representation which offers with a topic model of the direct speech and the  narrative text a simple proxy for the types of verbal actions and the action types is also created. To assess the ability of these information structures to indicate changes   in the temporal structures three evaluation methods are used based on artificial data.   We can confirm that a very abstract representation of the plot is able to do so, but   contrary to our expectations the more information-rich model which makes use of the   topic model is not better in doing so. The main contribution of this paper is its   attempt to integrate different research proposals into one integral model. We offer a   descriptive framework and a proposal for the formal model of plot, which makes it   possible to identify research problems and align existing approaches.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

A large body of scholarship known as ``thing theory’’ has attempted to understand the function of fictional things within literature mostly by focusing on small case studies. We provide the first-ever estimates of the distribution of different types of things in English-language fiction over the past two centuries along with experiments to model their semantic identity. Our findings suggest that the most common fictional things are structural in nature, functioning akin to narrative props. We conclude by showing how these findings pose problems for inherited theories of fictional things and propose an alternative theoretical framework, embodied cognition, as a way of understanding the predominance of structural things.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

This paper presents a study that uses literary reviews as a proxy for aesthetic judgment in order to identify systematic components that can be attributed to bias. Specifically, we find that judgments of literary quality differ across media types and display a gender bias. In newspapers, male reviewers have a same-gender preference while female reviewers show an opposite–gender preference. On the other hand, in the blogosphere female reviewers prefer female authors. While alternative accounts exist of this apparent gender disparity, we argue that it reflects a cultural gender antagonism that is necessary to take into account when doing computational assessment of aesthetics.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

It derives from the broader otaku culture, which is also associated with video games, manga, cosplay, anime, and other forms of Japanese popular culture. Though the light novel lacks the global reach of some of these other genres, such as manga and anime, it nonetheless attracts millions of readers across a range of gender and age groups. While distinct subgenres of the light novel have emerged, such as romance, adventure, horror, and harem, issues of gender stereotyping, power imbalances and other forms of inequality remain strongly entrenched. These issues can be attributed to how otaku culture is rooted in heterosexual male desire. This paper offers a quantitative assessment of these issues of gender inequality. We analyze 290 light novels, scraped from the Baka-Tsuki Translation Community Wiki, in terms of the power relationships between female and male characters as they evolve over the course of each novel. We find patterns consistent with issues of gender stereotyping and power differentials. More specifically, we find that female characters consistently wield less power than male characters, especially toward the end of each novel. We find some variation in specific subgenres. We conclude with close readings of two light novels, demonstrating how a power frames approach to analyzing gender stereotypes in otaku culture augments existing work on the subject.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

However it is not a straightforward task, as genre labels can be ambiguous and subject to temporal change, and moreoever many books consist of mixed or miscellaneous genres. In this paper we describe a work-in-progress method by which genre predictions can be used to determine longer sequences of genre change within books, which we test out with visualisations of some hand-picked texts. We apply state-of-the-art methods to the task, including a BERT-based transformer and character-level Perceiver model, both pre-trained on a large collection of eighteenth century works (ECCO), using a new set of hand-annotated documents created to reflect historical divisions. Results show that both models perform significantly better than a linear baseline, particularly when ECCO-BERT is combined with tfidf features, though for this task the character-level model provides no obvious advantage. Initial evaluation of the genre sequence method shows it may in the future be useful in determining and dividing the multiple genres of miscellaneous and hybrid historical texts.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Outside of classical meters, describing the metrical structure of a poem in a large corpus requires expertise and a shared scientific theory. In a situation when both components are lacking, alternative and continuous measures of regularity can be envisioned. This paper focuses on poetic rhythm to propose a simple entropy-based measure for poem regularity using counts of non-stressed intervals. The measure is validated using subsets of a well-annotated Russian poetic corpus, prose, and quasi-poems (prose chopped into lines). The regularity measure is able to detect a clear difference between various organizational principles of texts: average entropy rises when moving from accentual-syllabic meters to accentual variations to free verse and prose. Interval probabilities, when taken as a vector of features, also allow for classification at the level of individual poems. This paper argues that distinguishing between meter as a cultural idea and rhythm as an empirical sequence of sounds can lead to better understanding of form recognition and prosodic annotation problems.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Discussed topics varied from records of price fluctuations to local politics, and from weather reports to remarkable gossip. What we do not know yet, is to what extent times of conflict and crises influenced the way in which people dealt with information. We have applied methods from information theory – dynamics in word usage and measures of relative entropy such as  novelty  and  resonance  – to a corpus of early modern chronicles from the Low Countries (1500–1820) to provide more insight in the way early modern people were coping with information during impactful events. We detect three peaks in the novelty signal, which coincide with times of political uncertainty in the Northern and Southern Netherlands. Topic distributions provided by Top2Vec show that during these times, chroniclers tend to write more and more extensively about an increased variation of topics.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Estimating the Size of the Dutch East India Company Using an Unseen Species Model\nAbstract: Historians base their inquiries on the sources that are available to them. However, not all sources that are relevant to the historian’s inquiry may have survived the test of time. Consequently, the resulting data can be biased in unknown ways, possibly skewing analyses. This paper deals with the Dutch East India Company its digitized ledgers of contracts. We apply an unseen species model, a method from ecology, to estimate the  actual  number of unique seafarers contracted. We find that the lower bound of actual seafarers is much higher than what the remaining contracts indicate: at least, thirty-six percent of the seafarers is unknown. Moreover, we find that even in periods when few records survived, we can still credibly estimate a lower bound on the unique number of seafarers.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

In this paper, we propose a unified, formal framework for two fundamental questions in the study of the transmission of texts: how much was lost or preserved from all works of the past, and why do their genealogies (their \"phylogenetic trees’‘) present the very peculiar shapes that we observe or, more precisely, reconstruct? We argue here that these questions share similarities to those encountered in evolutionary biology, and can be described in terms of \"genetic’’ drift and \"natural’’ selection.  Through agent-based models, we show that such properties as have been observed by philologists since the 1800s can be simulated, and confronted to data gathered for ancient and medieval texts across Europe, in order to obtain plausible estimations of the number of works and manuscripts that existed and were lost.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Correlating the bottom-up, linguistic feature driven clustering with text type distinctions (medium and register) enables us to quantify the influence of individual author choice and medium/register conventions on variable linguistic phenomena. Our pilot study applies the method to German particles and intensifiers in a multimedia corpus, annotated for register. We show that German particles and intensifiers differ across both register and medium. The clustering based on the linguistic features most closely corresponds to the medium distinction, while the stratification into registers is reflected to a lesser extent.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

To do this, we used Bert Emotion to assign probability scores for eight different emotions to each text in a time series of 43 million Danish tweets from 2019-2022. We find that variance in the information signals novelty and resonance reliably identify seasonal shifts in posting behavior, particularly around the Christmas holiday season, whereas variance in  the distribution of emotion scores corresponds to more local events such as major inflection points in the Covid-19 pandemic in Denmark. This work in progress suggests that emotion scores are a useful tool for diagnosing shifts in the baseline information state of social media platforms such as Twitter, and for understanding how social media systems respond to both predictable and unexpected external events.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Governmental decisions, notarial deeds and official charters often contain fixed expressions to ensure that the same legal aspects in different documents had the same interpretation.  Such formulaic expressions can be used to identify specific elements of a document. For instance, a deed has different formulas to indicate whether it concerns the sale of property or the transferal of rights.  In this paper we explore formulas as a methodological devise to structure the text of an administrative corpus and make the information contained in it better accessible. We use a data-driven method to detect potential formulaic expressions in historical corpora, that can deal with spelling variation and change and recognition errors introduced in the digitisation process. We apply this exploratory technique on a corpus of almost 300,000 eighteenth-century resolutions of the States General of the Dutch Republic and find many formulaic expressions that capture relationships between the political actors involved and the decisions that were made. A first analysis suggests that many formulas can be used to add metadata to individual resolutions on various elements of the proposals and decisions that are part of each resolution.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

By means of an experiment on the historical ARCHER corpus, we show that lexical diversity at the level of functional groups is less sensitive to orthographic variation, and provides insight into an important and often disregarded dimension of vocabulary diversity in textual data.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Increasingly, the perceived value of goods was not only determined by the intrinsic quality of the goods, but also by the socio-commercial discourse used to characterise them. Linguistic modifiers, such as adjectives, must have played an important role in this process – reflecting these socio-economical trends in text while also reinforcing them. Here, we focus on a diachronic corpus of over 5,000 pages of London auction advertisement pages, digitised via automated transcription and divided across four sample periods between 1742-1829. Prime methodological challenges include: (1) the noisiness of the available data because of imperfect transcription; (2) the coarseness of the available time stamps, and (3) the lack of suitable NLP software, such as lemmatizers or (shallow) syntactic parsers. Through the use of word embeddings, we try to alleviate the issue of spelling variation with reasonable success. We find that, over time, subjective or ‘evaluative’ modifiers have become more prominent in these advertisements than their objective or ‘descriptive’ counterparts – but there are different temporal patterns for different types of advertised objects\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Fine-tuning a BERT Model to Explore a Stylistic Phenomenon\nAbstract: The narrative work of well-known Italian author Italo Calvino (1923-1985) features a phenomenon that literary critics refer to as ``dubitative text’': this stylistic device consciously hinders the narrative progression of a story, by questioning its own content. We report on an attempt to model the presence of dubitative text in Calvino’s fictional oeuvre and examine whether this model can also be used to retrieve dubitative instances in his essayistic oeuvre. We hypothesize that precisely the category of the dubitative text yields interesting points of intersection between both writing modes. We fine-tuned a BERT model based on a manually annotated dataset and report inter-annotator scores. We situate our findings and model criticism in the current landscape of Calvino scholarship. While detecting dubitative text is challenging, our model provides fresh insights into the device’s surface features.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Also, new Latin comedies are again written in quantities never seen before (at least 10,000 works published 1500 to 1800 are known). The authors themselves, within the game of literary imitation (the process of  imitatio), start to mimic the style of ancient authors, and Terence’s dramas in particular were considered the prime sources of reuse for many decades.   Via a case study “the reception of Terence’s  Eunuchus  in Early Modern literature”, we take a deep dive into the mechanisms of literary imitation. Our analysis is based on four comedy corpora in Latin, Italian, French and English, spanning roughly 3 centuries (1400-1700). To assess the problem of language shift and multi-language inter-corpora analysis, we base our experiments on translations of the  Eunuchus , one for each sub-corpus. Through the use of tools drawn from the field of Stylometry, we address the topic of text reuse and textual similarities between Terence’s text and Early-Modern corpora to get a better grasp on the internal fluctuations of the imitation game between Early Modern and Classical authors.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Similarly, the construction of co-occurrence networks of literary characters, and their analysis using methods from social network analysis and network science, have provided insights into the micro- and macro-level structure of literary texts. Combining these perspectives, in this work we study character networks extracted from a text corpus of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Legendarium. We show that this perspective helps us to analyse and visualise the narrative style that characterises Tolkien’s works. Addressing character classification, embedding and co-occurrence prediction, we further investigate the advantages of state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks over a popular word embedding method. Our results highlight the large potential of graph learning in Computational Literary Studies.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

We present a study on the relation between sentiment fractality and literary appreciation by testing the hypothesis that fairy tales with a good balance between unpredictability and excessive self-similarity in their sentiment narrative arcs tend to be more popular and more appreciated by audiences of readers. In short, we perform a correlation study of the degree of fractality of the fairy tales of the Grimm brothers and their current appreciation as measured by their Goodreads scores. Moreover, we look at the popularity of these fairy tales through time, determining which ones have come to form a strong “internal canon” in the corpus of the authors and which one have fallen into relative obscurity.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

With highly complex layouts and mixed scripts, scholarly commentaries are text-heavy documents which remain challenging for state-of-the-art models. Their layout considerably varies across editions and their most important regions are mainly defined by semantic rather than graphical characteristics such as position or appearance. This setting calls for a comparison between textual, visual and hybrid approaches. We therefore assess the performances of two transformers (LayoutLMv3 and RoBERTa) and an objection-detection network (YOLOv5). If results show a clear advantage in favor of the latter, we also list several caveats to this finding. In addition to our experiments, we release a dataset of ca. 300 annotated pages sampled from 19th  century commentaries.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

These images are widely reproduced and recognised and can therefore be considered memorable. A question that arises given such images is whether the memorability of iconic images is intrinsic or whether it is shaped. In this work we analyse the memorability of iconic images by means of computational  techniques that are specifically designed to measure the intrinsic memorability of images. To judge whether iconic images are inherently more memorable we establish two baselines based on datasets of diverse imagery and of newspaper imagery. Our findings show that iconic images are not more memorable than modern day newspaper imagery or when compared to a diverse set of everyday images. In fact, by and large many of the iconic images analysed score on the low end of the memorability spectrum. Additionally, we explore the variation in memorability of reproductions of iconic images  and find that certain images have been edited resulting in higher memorability scores,  but that the images by and large are reproduced with memorability close to the original.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Getting models robust to scribal and material changes is a necessary step for specific data mining tasks. However, evaluation of HTR results requires ground truth to compare prediction statistically. In the context of modern languages, successful attempts to evaluate quality have been done using lexical features or n-grams. This, however, proves difficult in the context of spelling variation that both Old French and Latin have, even more so in the context of sometime heavily abbreviated manuscripts. We propose a new method based on deep learning where we attempt to categorize each line error rate into four error rate ranges ( 0 < 10 %  < 25  %  < 50 %  < 100 % ) using three different encoder (GRU with Attention, BiLSTM, TextCNN). To train these models, we propose a new dataset engineering approach using early stopped model, as an alternative to rule-based fake predictions. Our model largely outperforms the n-gram approach. We also provide an example application to qualitatively analyse our classifier, using classification on new prediction on a sample of 1,800 manuscripts ranging from the 9th century to the 15th.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

The idea of digital transition evokes a feeling of disruption, but also of inevitability and becoming, mixing the voluntarism or the design of the artificial with new evolutionary narratives. Between a lingering post-historical atmosphere and the spectre of an era of extinctions, the certainty of the digital transformatio…",

          "description": "17 Feb 2023 - 00:00\n\n\n\nCfP: UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Association launches Community Interest Groups\n\n\n\nThe Association is announcing a Call for Proposals for Community Interest Groups (CIGs) - community-driven groups which are organised around a specific research interest, an existing community of practice, or a salient issue within the digital humanities community.\nThese groups will serve as one of the primary vehicles for community building within the Association. They will help the Association become more inclusive, collaborative, and sustainable by providing spaces that respond to community needs.\nCIGs are meant to be flexible, so that CIGs can emerge, transform and disband as priorities change within the field. CIGs will receive support from the Association, including use of the Association’s social media channels, a place on the Association’s website, the opportunity to participate in Association events, regular chances to feedback on issues related to the CIG’s area of interest, and formal opportunities to collaborate with other CIGs and external organisations.\nFor information about the proposal process, please see the instructions here: https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/resources/cig_cfp/\nProposals can be submitted to uk-ie.digitalhumanities@sas.ac.uk by 5:00 PM GMT on Friday, 17 February 2023. If you have any questions about the process, please email uk-ie.digitalhumanities@sas.ac.uk.\nIf you'd like to learn more about the Association, please visit our website at https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/",

As described in the \"Essential Guide to Coding Qualitative Data\" (https://delvetool.com/guide), one of the main field of application of such a procedure is Ethnography, but not only.\n\nThanks to qualitative data coding it is possible to enrich texts through adding labels and descriptions to specific passages, that are generally pinpointed by means of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis softwares (CAQDAS). This can be valid for several fields of applications, from the humanities to biology, from sociology to medicine.\n﻿In their paper, Pretnar Žagar, Ðukic´  and Muršicˇ illustrate how relying on a couple of taxonomies (or onthologies) already known in anthropological studies may represent an asset to automatize and hasten the process of data labelling. These taxonomies are the Outline of Cultural Materials (OCM) and the ETSEO (acronym for Ethnological Topography of Slovenian Ethnic Territory) systematics. In both cases we deal with taxonomies elaborated and applied in ethnographic research in order to organize and better analyze concepts and categories related to human cultures and traditions.\n\n[Click ‘Read more’ for the full post!]",

Stephanie Vie and Jennifer deWinter explain some of the tools digital humanists can use for critical discourse analysis and visualization of data collected from social media platforms. Although not all the tools they mention are open source, the majority of them have free to use or freemium versions, including AntConc, a free-to-use concordancing tool, or several Twitter data visualisation tools such as Tweeps map or Tweetstats.\n\nEven though the video does not provide just-as-good open source alternatives to Atlas.ti or MAXQDA (an obviously a recurrent question or shortcoming that is recurrently discussed on OpenMethods), it sets an excellent example for how to introduce tool criticism in the classroom alongside introduction to certain Digital Humanities Tools. After briefly touching upon both advantages and disadvantages of each tool, they encourage their audience (students in Digital Humanities study programs) to pilot each of them by using the same data-set and not only compare their results but also reflect on the epistemic processes in-between.\n\nSharing the video on Humanities Commons with stable archiving, DOI and rich metadata is among the best things that could happen to teaching resources of all kinds.",

The paper captures the procedure that has applied by starting from an overview about the application of ontologies to music, as well as of the so- called 'façade-based' approach to knowledge graphs, which is at the core of the SPARQL Anything software. Then, it moves to an illustration of the passages involved (i.e., melody extraction, N-grams extraction, N-grams analysis and exploitation\nof the Music Notation Ontology). Finally, it provides some considerations regarding the result of the experiment in terms of effectiveness of the queries' performance. In conclusion, the authors highlight how further studies in the field may cast an increasingly brighter light on the application of semantic-oriented methods and techniques to computational musicology. \n[Click ‘Read more’ for the full post!]",

This sets the stage for the second part that consists of 5 case studies (Statistics Essentials: WhoReads Novels? ; Introduction to Probability ; Narrating with Maps ; Stylometry and the Voice of Hildegard ; A Topic Model of United States Supreme Court Opinions, 1900–2000 ) showcasing how to draw meaningful insights from data using quantitative methods. Each chapter contains executable Python codes and ends with exercises ranging from easier drills to more creative and complex possibilities to adapt the apply and adopt the newly acquired knowledge to their own research problems.\n\nThe book exhibits best practices in how to make digital scholarship available in an open, sustainable ad digital-native manner, coming in different layers that are firmly interlinked with each other. Published with Princeton University Press in 2021, hardcopies are also available, but more importantly, the digital version is an  Open Access Jupyter notebook that can be read in multiple environments and formats (.md and .pdf). The documentation, coda and data materials are available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/3560761#.Y3tCcn3MJD9).

Recent publications taking advantage of such digital affordances have included monographs, enhanced journals, hybrid digital & print projects, as well as podcasts. How are these projects designed and developed to be sustainable, discoverable, and accessible in the long term? Who is publishing them? And how can graduate students and early career scholars acquire the skills and/or find support to develop digital publications? \nThis presentation will address how academic publishers are approaching multimodal born-digital and hybrid publications, as well as how libraries are supporting contemporary digital publishing methods. In particular it will introduce the range of recent scholarly digital publications and the University Presses actively seeking proposals. It will also touch on considerations for developing a digital publication, including the DH skill set learning curve, pitching a project to an editor, writing for a public audience, platforms, preservation, and accessibility, and resources for getting started.\n\n\nSubtitle: \n\nMultimodal Digital Scholarship\n\n\nImage for Left Column:",

If you’ve ever made something, it is likely that you’ve experienced failure. Lots of it. Or, paraphrasing Samuel Beckett, hopefully you have failed better. Over the last decade, game designers John Sharp and Colleen Macklin have interviewed creative practitioners—from chefs to skateboarders, filmmakers to winemakers, and toy designers to comedians to see how they manage the inevitable failures encountered in their practices. Join Sharp and Macklin as they share some of the lessons they’ve learned from game design and other creative disciplines. Because while everyone fails, some do it better. Because without f…",

A service provider as well as a device maker, Apple brands its media productions as exactingly as it does its phones, tablets, computers, and watches. As a result, its content is branded in ways that Netflix and HBO Max’s, for example, is not; indeed, Apple’s still relatively small stable of film and TV content expresses the firm’s manufacturing interests in ways that even Sony’s content, say, does not. This talk establishes the coherence of Apple’s TV branding and asks how it should matter to a materialist critical practice. Specifically, it asks if the very coherence of Apple’s trans-corporate branding makes it possible to glimpse in Apple content the otherwise hidden, outsourced, upstream production processes upon which the company still depends.\nMichael Szalay is Professor of English at the University of California, Irvine. He teaches 20th- and 21st-century fiction, television, and film, as well as courses on World-Systems Theory and the origins of capitalism. His first two books (Hip Figures: A Literary History of the Democratic Party and New Deal Modernism: American Literature and the Invention of the Welfare State) examine the relationship between literature, liberal governance, and economic crisis. His forthcoming book, Second Lives: Black-Market Melodramas and the Reinvention of Television (Chicago, 2023), defines a new television genre—the black-market melodrama—that has driven the ascent of TV as a cultural force over the last two decades, and that continues to mediate the ongoing effects of deindustrialization on a changing U.S. middle class.\n \n\n\nSubtitle: \n\nOvercoming Severance, from Lumon to Foxconn\n\n\nImage for Left Column:",

We seek to understand the ways in which the canon of Russian literature was conceptualized and composed differently in different translated contexts; to query Pascale Casanova’s claim that Paris was the most important “capital” of the “World Republic of Letters”; and to determine which other locales played a significant role in the process of a “peripheral” literature’s incorporation into “world literature” in the space of less than a century.\n19C RLT currently tracks book publications of works by Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky into English, French, and German from the death of Pushkin in 1837 to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, comprising a growing database as well as maps, graphs, and other visualizations of the data. Future phases are planned to add more authors and expand the scope to include other global contexts in which Russian literature became an important translated literature in the twentieth century and beyond.\nContributors:\nScott Bartling\nAndrew Basile\nRachel Dennis\nEmily Despinoy\nCatherine Fantuzzo\nAisha Garaeva\nEkaterina Kokovikhina\nSergey Miroshkin\nJan Nowak\nLydia Shaw\nEugenia Ulanova\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert an Image: \n\n\n\n\nCo-Investigators: \n\nHilah Kohen (Penn)\nOlga Nechaeva (Penn)\nJ.D.

I’m hoping to add some more content in the coming months, but for now I just did a bit of maintenance – updating Python packages and config files, including tests, and setting up automated builds of Docker containers. The documentation pages have also had a bit of a refresh. More soon!\nTrove lists and tags\nFor the Everyday Heritage digital workshop last November, I added a new notebook to convert a Trove list into a CollectionBuilder exhibition.

I ended up trying to find references to countries in a collection of 90,000 OCRd books. Of course I struck a few problems along the way, and didn’t get nearly as much done as I’d hoped, but that was really part of the point – to find the problems and explore the possibilities.

Edited by Paul Ashton and Paula Hamilton, the book ‘explores the complex, multi-roomed house of Australian history’, exploring academic, school, and public history, the impact of digital technologies, and the relationship of history to memory, social justice, politics, and cultural practice.\nMy chapter ‘Digital revolutions: The limits and affordances of online collections’ looks at how digitisation of GLAM collections has (and hasn’t) changed historical practice:\nAs the COVID lockdowns in 2020 emphasised, the online availability of  primary source materials makes historical research possible even when  access to the originals is limited. But the undoubted convenience of  being able to browse 200 years worth of newspapers at home masks other  issues that historians have been slow to acknowledge and address. How do we discover relevant resources? What gets digitised and why? How can  researchers use these collections to ask new types of questions? After more than 25 years, the web has its own history. What problems and  possibilities has it brought to the way we understand the past?\nIt’s available as a green open access preprint on Zenodo.",

          "description": "The Trove Newspaper Harvester has been around in different forms for more than a decade. It helps you download all the articles in a Trove newspaper search, opening up new possibilities for large-scale analysis. You can use it as a command-line tool by installing a Python package, or through the Trove Newspaper Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench.\nI’ve just overhauled development of the Python package. The new trove-newspaper-harvester replaces the old troveharvester repository. The command-line interface remains the same (with a few new options), so it’s really a drop in replacement. Read the full documentation of the new package for more details.\n\nHere’s a summary of the changes:\nthe package can now be used as a library (that you incorporate into your own code) as well as a standalone command-line tool – this means you can embed the harvester in your own tools or workflows\nboth the library and the CLI now let you set the names of the directories in which your harvests will be saved – this makes it easier to organise your harvests into groups and give them meaningful names\nthe harvesting process now saves results into a newline-delimited JSON file (one JSON object per line) – the library has a save_csv() option to convert this to a CSV file, while the CLI automatically converts the results to CSV to maintain compatibility with previous versions\nbehind the scenes, the package is now developed and maintained using nbdev – this means the code and documentation are all generated from a set of Jupyter notebooks\nthe Jupyter notebooks include a variety of automatic tests which should make maintenance and development much easier in the future\nI’ve also updated the Trove Newspaper Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench to use the new package. The new core library will make it easier to develop more complex harvesting examples – for example, searching for articles from a specific day across a range of years. If you find any problems, or want to suggest improvements, please raise an issue.",

          "description": "The talk critically discusses the opportunities and challenges of developing serious video games on contested past. Vít Šisler, the lead game designer of the critically acclaimed historical games Attentat 1945 and Svoboda 1945: Liberation, will revisit the games’ development process and summarise key lessons learned during the latter. In particular, the talk will focus on the intersections and tensions between authenticity and fiction, realism and schematisation, and narrativity and procedurality.\nVít Šisler is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Information Science and Librarianship at Charles University’s Faculty of Arts in Prague. He is also a co-founder of Charles Games, an indie game studio pushing the boundaries of narrative and serious games. He was a lead game designer of the award-winning video games Attentat 1942 (Best Learning Game, Games for Change 2018) and Svoboda 1945: Liberation (Grand Jury Award, IndieCade, 2022).\n \n\n\n \nThursday, 30 March 2023\n16.30 – 18:00\n \nMaison du Savoir, Auditorium 3.530, Belval Campus\nand online: https://unilu.webex.com/unilu/j.php?MTID=m555a452fb98f430094f0a6d5e907af88\n \nFree entrance.

          "description": "The office building is one of quintessential architectural typologies of the twentieth century. Without any doubt, moreover, “the office” is one of the social institutions that has contributed to the formation and definition of modernity in the broad sense. Yet remarkably, historical research has only recently begun to pick up on the office building and its corresponding “office cultures”. In this seminar, I will explore some recent historiographical approaches, including Delphine Gardey’s notion of the office building as a “technical-organisational complex”. For Gardey, the office is characterised by an interplay of architectural/technical infrastructures (the “hardware”) on the one hand, and normative ideas on the occupants’ behaviour (the “software”) on the other hand. This combined focus on both architecture and its managerial determinants is also at the heart of the ongoing BUREU project. \nHaving started in 2022, BUREU is a transnational research project (C²DH / University of Leuven) that aims to expand our knowledge of office buildings, their planning, and their usage. It does this through a series of case studies on EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg. This way, BUREU also aims to contribute to existing scholarship on “hidden integration” processes in Europe. Besides sketching the project’s general research aims, I will also provide some tentative research results on the European Investment Bank and its late-1970s headquarters on Kirchberg.\n \nWednesday, 15 February 2023\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Sapce and Webex\n15 February 2023\n  BUREU: EU office buildings between architectural “hardware” and managerial “software”, 1950s-2000\n  Design  European infrastructures  European integration  History of technology  Oral history  Political history  Post-war era  Transnationalism  Visual and material culture\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "When the first cases of what would be later recognized as AIDS were diagnosed in France, Belgium and the UK in late 1981 and early 1982, the European Community had no legal competence to deal with the emergence of a new disease. More than that, it had no competence to act in the field of public health, which had remained the prerogative of the member states since the beginning of the European integration. But as all member states detected some cases in the following months or years, and as the fear of a deadly pandemic rose in the European public opinion, the EC, which was simultaneously going through a new dynamic of integration (leading to the enlargements of 1982 and 1986, to the Single European Act in 1987, and to the Maastricht Treaty in 1992), was under pressure to “do something” and…",

          "description": "This conference will present current research on video game heritage in Switzerland, implying two research projects, Pixelvetica (2021-2022) and Confederatio Ludens (2023-2027). Pixelvetica provided a report on the current state of preservation in Switzerland, including guidelines aimed at politicians, heritage institutions, or game developers. We will present and discuss the conclusions from this report. Confederatio Ludens, a joint project of four universities (HKB, UNIBE, ZHdK, UNIL), will start in February 2023 and addresses a gap in the understanding of the Swiss video game industry and its cultural impact in the 20th Century. This project draws on existing research and will present and discuss the methodological challenges we are facing, for example in terms of oral history (many key actors are still alive), analysis of source code, and digital archiving. The talk will also introduce the field of game studies and its importance in understanding the broader cultural and societal context of video games.\nYannick Rochat is a professor assistant in game studies at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland (Department of Language and Information Sciences, Faculty of Arts). His research activities are dedicated to the study of video game and computer heritage in Switzerland as well as the use of video games for teaching.

In this lecture, Pieter Van den Heede discusses how the war, and the Holocaust in particular, are simulated in currently available games, and to what extent game designs can be leveraged to highlight alternative perspectives. He will do so in light of recent debates in the field of Holocaust & Genocide Studies, in particular in relation to the work of Frank Bajohr, Andrea Löw and Dirk Moses.\nPieter Van den Heede is a lecturer and researcher at the History Department of Erasmus University Rotterdam. His research focuses on historical culture (i.e. how people in the past and present relate to the past), public history, history didactics and digital humanities. In 2021, he completed his PhD dissertation on how digital games depict the Second World War, and what it means for people to play these games.\n \nTuesday, 28 February 2023\n17.00 – 18.30\nBlack Box\nMaison des Sciences Humaines, Belval Campus\nand online\nThe lecture will be followed by a reception.\nPlease confirm your participation before 22 February at vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu\n \n\n\n \n \n28 February 2023\n  Public history\n  Digital methods  Holocaust  Media history  WW2\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "The deportation of Crimean Tatars was a state-organized and forcible eviction of Crimean Tatars people that was ordered by Joseph Stalin as a form of collective punishment in 1944. It was supposed to completely remove the Crimean Tatar nationality from the demographic map of the world. It ruined the traditional way of life, social structure, and cultural institutes of Crimean Tatars. Indeed, Crimean Tatars were supposed to assimilate in exile. As a result of state-sponsored violence, Crimean Tatars became a nation in exile. After Stalin's death they did not receive the right to return to Crimea and renew their autonomy, like most \"punished peoples.\" However, Crimean Tatars escaped the fate and managed to reshape their identity. Moreover, despite the ban, Crimean Tatars tried to return to their homeland during the Soviet era.\nIn the presentation the question \"How did Crimean Tatars returnees dealt with 'homecoming'?\" will be answered. Studying the Crimean Tatars' return contribute significantly not only to the history of Crimean Tatars, moreover, it is important for the understanding of reverse migration process in migration studies. The research, foremost, is based on oral history interviews. So the special attention will be paid to doing Oral History in Crimea.\n \n\n\n \nA historian of Crimean Tatars, Martin-Oleksandr Kisly (History Department of National university of Kyiv-Mohyla academy) holds a Candidate of Science degree, having defended a dissertation entitled \"Crimean Tatars’ Return to the Homeland in 1956–1989\". His research focuses on memory, trauma, identity and migration. Fulbright Research and Development program fellow (2017, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor).

Though gender and sexuality are “useful categories of historical analysis” (Joan W. Scott), they remain profoundly recalcitrant, as they combine liberalisation and repression, consent and violence, the private and the public… As I shall argue, masculinities offer insightful perspectives for understanding German society and Europe at war. Nazism, which advocated an ideal of comradeship and racial purity, regulated gender, sexualities and procreation through racist, homophobic, sexist and eugenic laws. Yet the period also saw the coexistence of sexual constraints and forms of gender violence with the opening of new spaces for sexual and gender experimentation. The Nazi war of…",

          "description": "Taking the post-conflict context of Northern Ireland as a case study, this lecture will explore some of the challenges of engaging in Public History in a region where the prevailing historical narratives are contested at the most basic level. It will ask to what extent the public use of history plays a part in reinforcing divisions and continuing senses of ‘otherness’. However, it will also look at the important role public history can play in such contexts either as a form of conflict transformation, disrupting dominant narratives and opening up space for dialogue, or as a means of promoting wellbeing and increased senses of belonging among divided and often disadvantaged urban communities. \n \n\nMonday, 14 November 2022\n18.00 - 19.00 CET\nAquarium, 4th floor, Maison des Sciences humaines\n11, Porte des Sciences humaines\nL-4366 Esch-sur-Alzette\nand online\n\n\n\nPlease register if you want to participate in-person or online.\n \nLegal notice\n\n14 November 2022\n  Public history\n  Public History as the New Citizen Science of the Past (PHACS)\n  Public History\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Comment tissait-on des liens entre sidérurgistes ou mineurs ? Comment déjouait-on les surveillances des gardes pour sortir du materiel ? Comment s’arrangeait-on pour « bricoler » sur place des objets qu’on ramenait ensuite à la maison ou dans son jardin ? Comment prenait-on des libertés sur les règlements ? Et qu’est devenue avec le temps cette autonomie ouvrière connue mais peu racontée ? Au final, à quoi servaient ces systèmes de transgression ?\n« L’usine secrète » dresse un portrait original et inhabituel du monde ouvrier et de ses évolutions sur 50 ans. Il fait partie de ces rares documentaires sur des sujets sérieux mais traités avec humour et donc pouvant aussi s’adresser « aux jeunes »… Car l’autonomie dans le travail est un thème universel.\n \nMardi, 6 décembre 2022\n16h30 - 18h30\nBlack Box\nMaison des Sciences humaines\n11, Porte des Sciences\nL-4366 Esch-sur-Alzette\n\n\n\nInscription gratuite.\n6 December 2022\n\n  \n  \n            \nPublic history\n  Industrial history\n  Outreach\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Their strength lies in building connections to communities and collecting materials that will be critical to future generations of scholars.

BAS makes speech resources from contemporary spoken German, as well as tools for the processing of digitised speech available to research and speech technology communities. The way in which the speech materials are structured allows flexible and precise access, with rich annotations, metadata and linguistic-phonetic evaluation.\nRead more about BAS here.\n \nCLARIN Centre of Latvian language resources and tools\n  \nCLARIN-LV recently received its Core Trust Seal certification, a pre-requisite to becoming a CLARIN B-centre. The CLARIN-LV repository was set up in March 2020 and focuses on collecting, documenting, curating and providing easy and sustainable long-term access to digital Latvian language data and tools for a wide group of users: the SSH research community, language technology developers, language teachers and students, and others (e.g. via citizen science). Access to the CLARIN-LV repository and its language resources and tools is open to the academic and research community, industry and also to the public, in accordance with Open Data Principles and FAIR Data Principles.   \nRead more about CLARIN-LV here.\n \nJulia Misersky\n 20 February 2023",

I started to work for CLARIN in the summer of 2015, the beginning of a journey that brought many moments of discovery, the unravelling of complexity, achievements, innovation and growth. Language matters, and therefore language resources matter. So leading the mission of making them findable and accessible, and pointing out the potential for impact along many dimensions of the richness that has been collected, annotated and deposited, in growing volumes and for a wide diversity of languages, has been a deeply rewarding role. The journey also brought many moments of personal inspiration and satisfaction, not least because of the many moments of warm collegial collaboration and exchange.\nAnd the future? The landscape of research infrastructures in which CLARIN is positioned is very dynamic and there always seem to be new horizons. But even though some of the envisaged scenarios for the future may never materialise, I trust that there will be a multitude of ways in which another generation of experts can show the way for CLARIN to be able to adapt to new conditions and policy frameworks. Being a crucial building block for any new stage that will result from the evolutionary path taken, that is what I wish for CLARIN. And of course that it can continue its role in enhancing the options for exploring the cultural and societal diversity that is reflected in language.

The distance learning course ‘Ukrainian History’ was developed by two friends and colleagues, based in Ukraine and Lithuania, as an example of collaboration between EU universities and Ukrainian researchers. The short distant learning course covers the history of Ukraine and its statehood, beginning with the Kyivan Rus’ state and its Ukrainian principalities (9th-13th c.) and then traces Ukraine’s historical development and its struggle for independence until the present day. \nRead more here.\n\n      Karina Berger\n 21 November 2022",

Unlike most existing video analysis tools that focus on individual videos, our approach allows for an overview of a larger collection of videos, which can be further examined based on their connections or communities. By utilizing scalable reading, specific subgraphs can be selected from the overview and their respective clusters can be explored in more detail on the video frame level.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

During the latter half of the fourteenth century, Herne served as a significant literary hotspot in the region around Brussels, with a devoted community of monks deeply involved in the production of (vernacular) texts and manuscripts, often as collaborative efforts. The corpus offers abundant material for the (computational) exploration of authorship, translation, and scribal cultures in the premodern Low Countries. Yet, much of this material has remained digitally inaccessible.  Here we describe the creation of an almost exhaustive, open-access dataset comprising diplomatic transcriptions of all known Middle Dutch Herne manuscripts, acquired through handwritten text recognition. Apart from rich codicological and textual metadata, we include a normalized text layer (with expanded abbreviations), as well as a linguistic annotation layer (with lemmas and part of speech tags). We conclude by discussing our work against current trends in medievalist scholarship. The dataset is released together with this paper and we encourage its re-use in future research.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

How do readers of digital library orient themselves within big corpora? What landmarks do they use to navigate masses of digital documents? Taking Gallica as a case study–the digital heritage platform of the French national library–, this paper presents an experimental research on the navigation practices of its users. Using methods from topological data analysis, we inferred from Gallica’s server logs an informational space as it is roamed by readers. Coupled with user interviews, this mixed-methods study allowed us to identify a set of “regimes of navigation” characterizing how readers deploy various strategies to browse the digital library’s corpus. From directed search to wandering to crawling, these regimes answer different needs and show that a single corpus can, in turns, be apprehended as a heritage collection, a database, a set of documents, and a mass of information.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Monitoring the Thematic Evolution of Medieval French Narratives\nAbstract: In this paper, we test a famous conjecture in literary history  put forward by Seignobos and de Rougemont according to which the French central medieval period (12-13th centuries) is characterized by an important increase in the cultural importance of love. To do that, we focus on the large and culturally important body of manuscripts containing medieval French long narrative fictions, in particular epics ( chansons de geste , of the Matter of France) and romances (chiefly  romans  on the Matters of Britain and of Rome), both in verse and in prose, from the 12th to the 15th century. We introduce the largest available corpus of these texts, the  Corpus of Medieval French Epics and Romances , composed of digitised manuscripts drawn from  Gallica , and processed through layout analysis and handwritten text recognition.   %  We then use  semantic representations based on embeddings  to monitor the place given to love and violence in this corpus, through time.  We observe that themes (such as the relation between love and death) and emblematic works well identified by literary history do indeed play a central part in the representation of love in the corpus, but our modelling also points to the characteristic nature of more overlooked works. Variation in time seems to show that there is indeed an phase of expansion of love in these fictions, in the 13th and early 14th century, followed by a period of contraction, that seem to correlate with the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Using an information-theoretical approach to author profiling, this paper tries to leverage some of these tools to reconstruct mental states in the Early Modern Spanish author Teresa of  ' A vila. We shift away from traditional static textual feature analysis and instead approach author profiling as a dynamic problem, requiring a representation of the author’s life history. Teresa of  ' A vila was an Early Modern Spanish mystic and Carmelite nun whose authorship offers a unique dataset due to her prolific output and well-preserved, digitized writings. We model Teresa’s letter corpus as a complex system with multiple states and try to track her mental and socio-cultural dynamics through lexical co-occurrence structures and affective valences in her letters. We find that Teresa’s letters reflect a life history of state switching between contemplation and revelation. This relatively new approach offers a more robust and dynamic perspective on author profiling in cultural heritage research.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Using neural network text embedding model to measure cultural innovation\nAbstract: Current discourse reflects a growing skepticism towards contemporary popular culture, specifically the realm of cinema, with an emerging consensus that its creative capacity is on a waning trajectory. This study introduces a novel approach which employs natural language processing techniques and embedding methods to measure semantic novelty of cultural items’ descriptions. We apply this methodology to cinema, analyzing plot summaries of over 19,000 movies from the United-States spanning more than a century. Our measure’s robustness is validated through a series of tests, including a fit with a genre-based novelty score, a manual inspection of films identified as highly innovative, and correlations with award recognitions. The application of our Innovation Score reveals a compelling pattern: an increase in the rate of cinematic innovation throughout the 20th century, followed by a stabilization in the rate of innovation in the 21st, despite an ever-growing production of films. Contrary to the often-voiced lament that cinema is losing its innovative edge, our study suggests that the level of innovativeness in cinema is not in decline.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

On one hand such interpretation is limited by the fact that data present in catalogue records is tabular and nominative, and not quantitative. On the other hand, such research is guided by tacit knowledge of scholars in the humanities, and thus it could be challenging to reproduce its results. We take inspiration from phenomenography, a discipline within educational research that examines how students perceive the phenomena being learned. We adopt the view that scientific inquiry is a collective form of learning. By doing this, we turn to the phenomenographic theory that variation is necessary to understand the phenomena being studied, and is achieved through three distinct patterns of variance: contrast, generalisation and fusion. We propose an approach to visualise the combination of nominal data and tacit knowledge by subjecting it to these three patterns. We illustrate our approach with two case studies from literary translations between Italy and the UK in the post-war 20th century. Our claim is that on one hand this guides scholars on how to analytically approach their research questions, on the other it drives them to externalise and validate hidden assumptions. Our approach offers a way of doing reproducible science not only when conducting literature research with bibliographic data. It is also applicable in the wider cases within the humanities when tabular data are available.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Corsica fitted very well within this dynamic and even presented itself as a favourable location for the development of such ideas. The centralization of the state around a strong capital and the policies of assimilation of the indigenous populations on the border with France led certain players to defend these particularisms. It was in this context that the Corsican autonomist newspaper  A Muvra  was born in May 1920 in Paris, under the impetus of Petru and Matteu Rocca. For almost 19 years, hundreds of authors participated in the writing of this massive dialectal work. This paper presents the results of a research that aimed to carry out author profiling, i.e., to determine the style and subjects covered by an author. The goals of this study were to determine the identity behind certain authors and also to highlight the role pseudonyms played in the newspaper’s propaganda. We conducted authorship attribution to achieve the first objective before completing these analyses with topic modelling in order to meet the second one.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

In an increasing body of research, emoji have variably been viewed as emotional data or personality identifiers. However, little attention has been paid to the social and political import of emoji. Using a dataset of politically active Twitter users in Poland, including 334 members of parliament and their 1,288,950 followers, we ask whether emoji are used for political self-representation, and discuss the implications for political identity formation and mobilisation online. Adapting a new method of ideal point estimation, we identify patterns in the employment of emoji in user Twitter bios across a latent political space computed from a Twitter following network. We find that emoji are used as stand-ins for offline political symbols such as  flag-european-union ,  rainbow-flag  and  latin-cross . Additionally, we find that the use of emoji without recognisable political meaning, such as  victory-hand ,  flexed-biceps ,  hundred-points  and  seedling  is contingent on a users estimated political ideal point. Users on the left are likelier to employ  victory-hand  and  seedling , while those on the right are likelier to employ  flexed-biceps  and  hundred-points . Using Ludwig Wittgenstein’s theory of language games, we argue that this points to the use of emoji for communication of both political values and affect, and to the development of a new political language game of emoji.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

We show that by augmenting such LLMs with vector embeddings from highly specialized academic sources, a conversational methodology can be made accessible to historians and other researchers in the Humanities. Concretely, we evaluate and demonstrate how LLMs have the ability of assisting researchers while they examine a customized corpora of different types of documents, including, but not exclusive to: (1). primary sources, (2). secondary sources written by experts, and (3). the combination of these two. Compared to established search interfaces for digital catalogues, such as metadata and full-text search, we evaluate the richer conversational style of LLMs on the performance of two main types of tasks: (1). question-answering, and (2). extraction and organization of data. We demonstrate that LLMs semantic retrieval and reasoning abilities on problem-specific tasks can be applied to large textual archives that have not been part of the its training data. Therefore, LLMs can be augmented with sources relevant to specific research projects, and can be queried privately by researchers.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Starting with the identification of essential structural parts of their plot based on scholarly analysis of romances, we then formalize this conceptual model.   After a description of the corpus with its 950 novels, mostly from the last 20 years, and the annotation guidelines for the selected plot elements, we automatically detect these elements using a fine-tuned German Bert (with LoRA adapters). While it is clear how to evaluate the performance of the automatic extraction of the plot elements, it is less clear how to evaluate the quality of the model in total. We apply it to two texts and compare the result to summaries of these novels based on reading them, to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the plot model in making aspects of the plot structure visible.  For the quantitative evaluation each novel is represented as a multidimensional time series data. Classifications of this data distinguish between publishers, genres and series respectively; we see the performance in this task as an indication of the quality of the model. Finally, applying the model to a larger corpus of romance novels, we detect patterns of the genre. The more modern form of the romance novel, published by the publishing house  Cora , is characterized by the importance of the physical perception and the reduction of the plot with the high and exclusive focus on the relationship of the lovers.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

However, under certain conditions, they hold significant potential for multifaceted exploration: First, through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text and its apparatus, coupled with intelligent parsing of the variant readings, it becomes possible to reconstruct comprehensive manuscript collations, which can prove invaluable for a variety of investigations, including phylogenetic analyses, redaction history studies, linguistic inquiries, and more. Second, by aligning the printed edition with manuscript images, a substantial amount of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) ground truth can be generated. This serves as valuable material for paleography, layout analysis, as well as for assessing the quality of the collation criteria adopted by the editor. The present paper focuses on the challenges mastered in the processes of the OCR, the apparatus parsing, the text reconstruction, and the alignment with the manuscript images, taking as a case study the edition of the Hebrew Bible published by Kennicott in the late eighteenth century.     %After a brief introduction (§ \\ref{introduction}) and a description of this edition (§ \\ref{kennicott}), we will provide an overview of the adopted method (§ \\ref{pipeline}), from image acquisition (§ \\ref{image_acquisition}) to the final textual reconstruction (§ \\ref{text_reconstruction}).

Given a beginning state of no knowledge about a story (beyond paratextual clues) and an end state of full knowledge about a story’s contents, what are the rhythms of dissemination through which we arrive at this final state? Using a dataset of over 2,700 books of contemporary English prose, we test for various time-dependent characteristics of narrative revelation against four stylistic categories of interest: audience age level, prestige, point-of-view, and fictionality.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

We use the  De Boer Scene Detection  dataset, containing 39,866 gray-scale historical press photographs from 1950 to 1999. The results show that zero-shot classification is relatively ineffective for image dating, with a bias towards predicting dates in the past. Fine-tuning OpenCLIP with a logistic classifier improves performance and eliminates the bias. Additionally, our analysis reveals that images featuring buses, cars, cats, dogs, and people are more accurately dated, suggesting the presence of temporal markers. The study highlights the potential of machine learning models like OpenCLIP in dating images and emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning for accurate temporal analysis. Future research should explore the application of these findings to color photographs and diverse datasets.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Poetry is commonly available on the web and often fits within language model context sizes. As LLMs continue to grow as a tool in literary analysis, the accessibility of poems will determine the effective canon. We assess whether we can prompt current language models to retrieve existing poems, and what methods lead to the most successful retrieval. For the highest performing model, ChatGPT, we then evaluate which features of poets best predict memorization, as well as document changes over time in ChatGPT’s ability and willingness to retrieve poetry.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Because most studies in LSCD only consider the semantic change of words in isolation, in this paper, we propose a new direction for the analysis of semantic shifts:  traveling word pairs . First, we introduce shift correlation to find pairs of words that semantically shift together in a similar fashion. Second, we propose word relation shift to analyze how the relationship between two words has changed over time. As a test case, we investigate the word  privacy (and related words identified by a pre-existing dictionary), as an example of a word that has shifted semantics historically and remains vibrantly explored as a concept in contemporary humanistic discourse. We report that the term  privacy  in comparison shows relatively little change initially – with correlation analysis revealing more about how key terms surrounding  privacy  have shifted in tandem, and explore nuanced changes through word pair analysis, suggesting a shift toward concreteness in particular.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Deconstruction of binary oppositions such as man/woman, black/white, left/right, and rich/poor is therefore increasingly encouraged. The question arises of what kind of effect the debate about binary oppositions has had on its linguistic use. We have therefore detected antonyms in a corpus of Dutch newspaper articles from the period 1990-2020, to study the development of binarism in journalism. Our method consists of two parts: the use of a good-old lexicon, and the finetuning of a BERT model for antonym detection. In this paper, we not only present our results regarding the (de)construction of binary oppositions in Dutch journalism, but we also reflect on the two methodological stages and discuss their gain.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Moreover, the same words can have other meanings while occurring in the sentence-final position. The tags’ felicity conditions were addressed in previous corpus-based and experimental work and attributed to semantic and pragmatic properties of tag questions. This paper addresses the question of whether and to what extent the differences among German tags can be determined automatically. We assess the performance of three pretrained German BERT models on a tag question dataset and fine-tune one of these models on the tag word prediction task. A close examination of this model’s output indicates that BERT can identify properties relevant for the tags’ felicity conditions and interchangeability consistent with previous studies.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

We evaluate the strengths and pitfalls of these methodologies by employing two datasets: one comprising ancient shipwrecks and the other ancient Greek inscriptions. While these objects can, in principle, be precisely dated to specific years, they are often assigned broader date ranges, spanning centuries or longer historical periods. We propose that the most promising approaches involve using these date ranges as defining probabilities. By randomly assigning specific dates based on these probabilities, we enable hypothesis testing for temporal trends.

A Case Study of Animals in Children’s Literature\nAbstract: The content of literary fiction at least partly depends on literary   tradition. The dependence is attested quantitatively in the   association of genre with lexical statistical patterns.  This short   paper is a step to formal modeling of the content-moderating   processes associated with literary genres.  The idea is to explain   prevalence of the particular lemmas in a literary text by the   genre-dependent accessibility of the semantic category during the   creative process. Data on animals mentioned in various sub-genres in   a corpus of Russian children’s literature is used as an empirical   case. Vocabulary growth models are applied to infer genre-related   differences in overall diversity of animal vocabularies. A   constrained topic model is employed to infer preferences for   particular animal lemmas displayed by various genres. Results   demonstrate the models’ potential to infer genre-related content   preferences in the context of high variance and data imbalance.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Here, we propose a different approach based on the production of immaterial works (e.g. poems, philosophical treatises, musical pieces, scientific work). Immaterial works require time, energy, resources, and human capital to be produced, disseminated and appreciated, and thus indirectly reflect a wide range of economic processes. Moreover, their survival rate tends to be higher because they can be abstracted from their initial material incarnation (e.g. scrolls, manuscripts) and preserved throughout the centuries. We build a large database of cultural producers (painters, scientists, etc.) that exist in online catalogs (Library of Congress ID, GND ID, VIAF ID, Iranica ID etc) and create an estimate of immaterial production that is robust and consistent across cultures and sources. We show that immaterial production in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome is closely related to economic development, and reveals important phases of economic development. Overall, immaterial production provides new insights into the roots and the evolution of economic development in the very long run in Classical Antiquity.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

The average person has more than 40 different apps on their phone and each app uses an average of 18 SDKs which gather, share, and process our data.

There’s still lots of things to add, update, and reorganise, but getting the basic content of the section defined is a bit of a milestone, so I’ll allow myself a little moment of celebration. Yay!\n\r\nOf course it took longer than I expected, but that’s largely due to the fact that I was sketching out related sections as I went along. You’ll see lots of pages in the navigation that only contain a list of dot points, but they’ll get filled out over the next couple of months.\nThe ‘Accessing data’ section is going to be the most code heavy, as it’s focused on using the API to develop reusable methods for harvesting machine-readable data. Other sections, such as ‘Understanding search’ and ‘Collections and contexts’ will be more discursive, aimed at helping all Trove users better understand what Trove is and how it works.\nComments and suggestions are welcome!

Unfortunately, the public Binder service has been having some capacity issues in the last few months, and sometimes repositories fail to run.

You just give it the url of a search in Trove’s newspapers, and it translates the search into a set of parameters that the API will understand. So this:\nparse_query(\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/search/category/newspapers?keyword=wragge&l-artType=newspapers&l-state=Queensland&l-category=Article&l-illustrationType=Cartoon\", 3)\nProduces this:\n{'q': 'wragge',\r 'l-artType': 'newspapers',\r 'l-state': ['Queensland'],\r 'l-category': ['Article'],\r 'l-illustrated': 'true',\r 'l-illtype': ['Cartoon'],\r 'category': 'newspaper'}\nYou can then feed the parameters to the Trove API with your API key and you’ll get data back. Easy! It’s simple but handy – I use the Query Parser in other tools like the Trove Newspaper Harvester and QueryPic.\nThis version adds a second parameter to the parse_query() function so you can specify the version of the Trove API you’re using. The default value is 2 for backwards compatibility. See the documentation for more information.",

I described my adventures in this blog post, but if you look at it now you’ll see lots of sad, empty boxes where live charts used to be.

It’s been online for 9 years now, and I’ve just updated it to use version 3 of the Trove API by default. I’ve also added a new ‘Share’ button that makes it easier to share and embed examples.\nIf you click on the ‘Share’ button, a box will pop up.\n\r\nIf you add a comment, this will appear above the example query when users follow the shared link. You can use this to provide them with some context or a description.\n\r\nThere are two buttons providing different share options:\nCopy share url – copies the full url to the shared example\nCopy Markdown button – copies a Markdown snippet that embeds a button like this  linked to your example. Just paste it into your Markdown-formatted documentation!\nOther improvements include:\nThe parameters used in any request are now displayed in a table for easy reference.\nThe Console includes a link to an API Status page. This page runs all the example queries in the Console and checks the results to make sure the API is working as expected. It’s updated every 6 hours.\nVersion 3 of the Trove API includes a standard Swagger UI that you can use to build queries, and provides limited anonymous access (without the need for an API key). But if, like me, you learn best by looking at examples, then you should find the API Console handy. In particular, the API Console makes it easy to share live examples which can be very useful in training, troubleshooting, and writing documentation. The Trove Data Guide, which I’m working on at the moment, includes lots of ‘Try it!’ buttons.",

          "description": "For its first one hundred and fifty years, the U.S. government had relatively few secrets, and subsidized the free flow of information to ensure democratic accountability. But all that changed after Pearl Harbor, with the rise of the dark state. The last two decades have witnessed particularly dramatic growth in government secrecy, at the same time that declassification has all but collapsed. Now that so much is secret, it has become all but impossible to protect truly dangerous information. Connelly explores the policies and practices that gave rise to the current crisis, above all presidents’ determination to preserve sovereign power over “national security information.” The digital archiving methods that were supposed to stop unauthorized leaks instead gave rise to Wikileaks, and the wholesale destruction of the documentary record has made it all but impossible even for historians to hold public officials to account. But new data science methods now make it possible to systematically analyze patterns and anomalies in state secrecy, and show not only what the government did not want us to know, but why.\n \n\n\n \nMatthew Connelly is a professor of international and global history at Columbia University, and director of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. Connelly is also the principal investigator of History Lab, a project that uses data science to analyze state secrecy. His publications include A Diplomatic Revolution: Algeria's Fight for Independence and the Origins of the Post-Cold War Era, Fatal Misconception: The Struggle to Control World Population, and The Declassification Engine: What History Reveals about America’s Top Secrets.

Moving beyond a one case study model, this presentation adopts a regional, thematic, and historical approach to elucidate the diverse ways in which African nations have grappled with colonial statues from the time of independences. The paper begins by examining the fate of colonial statues at the time of independences, exploring why certain monuments were removed, repurposed, or preserved. Subsequently, the paper delves into the reasons for the revival of (neo)colonial statues in the 1990s and early 2000s. Finally, the paper discusses recent and renewed contestations of colonial statues from the 2010s, in the light of global movements against symbols of oppression.

The talk will address how the team is using process analysis, formative assessments, and other critical making approaches to engage the practical, theoretical, and ethical questions that arise when using VR to engage with historical complexity, traumatic events, and still-vital human rights issues.\nClarissa J.

What challenges do these platforms present and how do they allow practitioners to subvert entrenched ideologies?

          "description": "In France, as elsewhere, the Covid 19 pandemic led to a large number of grassroots archiving projets. The aim of these initiatives was to collect the 'ordinary' memory of the event and thus help to build a collective memory that reflected a diversity of experiences. Using qualitative and quantitative data, this article examines the genesis of these initiatives in France and draws up the socio-economic profile of the participants, asking the question: to what extent did these operations reach the entire target population in an egalitarian manner? What kind of memory will be preserved over the long term by the archive centres, and who are the people whose words will go down in history?\nSarah Gensburger is a Full Professor of Sociology at the French National Center for Scientific Research - Sciences Po Paris. In her most recent work, she has been investigating the relationship between memory, public policies and neoliberalism. She is the author of a dozen of books among which, in the perspective of this talk, Memory on my doorstep.

          "description": "In this research seminar, we will discuss the ongoing extraction of data from the administrative archives of Dudelange, relying on an automated transcription, with layout detection and the automated extraction of temporal and spatial information from these sources to create historical maps.\nThe city of Dudelange has entered a partnership with the C²DH, for which they shared their residential cards. These administrative forms contain information on the population movements in and out of the city. These are being scanned and transcribed.\nFor the transcription, the project uses Transkribus to restitute not only the textual content of these administrative forms but also their structure, e.g., for each field, a tag is attached. Secondly, for the blocs of texts, a script to detect place and time information is being developed internally. All these steps should lead up to the structuration before import of the data to be visualised on a map and open these rich collections for further analysis, on the history of migration, housing, public health etc.\nWe invite all interested persons to join the discussion on how to improve this pipeline and share other potential uses for the extracted material.\n \nWednesday, 18 October 2023\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space\n18 October 2023\n  Digital history & historiography\n  Archives  Data Science  Digital methods  Digital tools  Digitisation  Visualisation\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

While many initially sought refuge in France, a minority was able to emigrate via neutral countries such as Spain or Portugal to safe havens like the USA.\nIn parallel with the examination of the fleeing population itself, the strategies it employs, as well as the geographic framework of the escape routes, the thesis investigates the influence of potential aid networks that impacted the flight marked by multiple motivations.\nIn addition to displaying the initial findings of the research, the presentation will also address the particular challenges regarding the transnational perspective and the micro historical character of the work as individual fates will particularly be woven into the discussion, as well as the connections to the project of the Mémorial de la Shoah au Luxembourg.\n \nWednesday, 20 Septemner 2023\n14.00 - 15.00\n\nC²DH Open Space \n20 September 2023\n  Contemporary history of Luxembourg\n  Digital Shoah Memorial Luxembourg\n  Holocaust  Jewish history  Migration history  WW2\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

CLARIN promotes interoperability by endorsing the adoption of open science standards. There is, however, a more intuitive notion of interoperability that involves language resources: be they corpora or lexicons, language resources are all made of a basic ingredient, i.e. words.

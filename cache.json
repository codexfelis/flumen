Her current research with the project is focused on developing and curating, in collaboration with graduate researchers, a corpus centering the print cultures of books authored by incarcerated Black writers and organizers of the late 20th century. The talk will explore the print cultures of Black prison movements while also attending to critical political, ethical and descriptive considerations involved in developing data about these works and writers. \n\nDr. Tajah Ebram is a cultural historian, teacher and community memory worker.

Christine earned her Ph.D. in the Ancient World from New York University in January 2023, where her doctoral work explored a premodern astronomical curriculum and its continued use in Greek and Arabic between the second and thirteenth centuries CE. Christine's research applies computational approaches to the study of manuscript transmissions in the Mediterranean world, particularly of mathematical and scientific works. During her postdoctoral term at Princeton, Christine is leveraging deep learning tools to classify and analyze visual data from digitized manuscripts, with a particular focus on paratextual material.\nThe written outputs of manuscript cultures are often characterized by a degree of multiformity, and certain texts see particularly high amounts of variation. Works used for didactic purposes, for instance, often saw multiple interventions in the hands of contemporary scholars and teachers. While digital imaging initiatives have made great strides in making manuscript materials more accessible, the fact that this data is in image format has until recently presented a speedbump for research that would grapple with such highly variable traditions. But this is changing with the machine learning technologies available today. This talk will explore how these tools can facilitate access at scale into the texts of digitized manuscript collections, as well as support research into material beyond the main text column, whether that material is textual (e.g., marginal annotations) or visual (e.g., scientific diagrams).\n\n\nImage for Left Column:",

          "description": "Project Start Date: \n\nAugust, 2024\n\n\n\nEl Movimiento Audiovisual en Nuevitas (MAN) hace referencia a la gestión comunitaria (producción, alfabetización audiovisual, exhibición y distribución) que un grupo de jóvenes viene desarrollando en esta localidad desde el año 2007. Esta iniciativa en principio se encuentra deslindada de la institución política-cultural oficial cubana. Responde al concurso de los esfuerzos de sus integrantes y de los pobladores del municipio. En materia de formación profesional artística el núcleo central proviene de las Escuelas de Instructores de Arte en las especialidades de Teatro, Plástica, Música y Danza. La curva de aprendizaje en materia de realización audiovisual se sustenta en la práctica y participación en talleres, conferencias, cursos, festivales y otras experiencias educativa-formativas. Hasta la fecha se han producido alrededor de 100 materiales entre ficciones, documentales, videos musicales, video arte y carteles. Desde el año 2012 organizan la muestra de audiovisuales Hieroscopia con carácter anual. En ella se exhiben tanto las obras producidas por el MAN como de otros espacios de producción comunitaria en Cuba. El encuentro sirve también para el intercambio teórico sobre la práctica audiovisual aprovechando la presencia de realizadores, críticos, periodistas y en general, personal disímil que se dedica a lo cinematográfico en la isla. Por la constancia en el trabajo, la gestión de espacios para la creación y el debate y la vocación por la superación técnica y estética, el MAN se ha convertido en un foco del audiovisual cubano contemporáneo.\n\n\nInsert an Image: \n\n\n\n\nProject Principal Investigator: \n\nArmando   Navarro-Rojas",

          "description": "A couple of months ago I realised my big, searchable database of Tasmanian Post Office Directories was missing the volume from 1920. It took a bit of work to add it in, as described in this post. Unfortunately, I’d barely finished when I realised that a number of other years were also missing! Argh! The good news is that I’ve been steadily working through these missing volumes, adding one a week, and now I’m finally, finally finished!\n\r\nThe new volumes are:\n1920\n1933-34\n1941-42\n1942-43\n1943-44\n1945-46\nIn total there are now 54 volumes from 1890 to 1948. Every line of every volume has been OCRd and indexed, so you can run fulltext searches across all 54 volumes to find matching entries. The fulltext search also supports advanced operators like wildcards and booleans.\nAs I mentioned in relation to 1920, while these volumes can be downloaded as PDFs from Libraries Tasmania, they don’t contain any OCRd text – they’re not searchable (despite what Libraries Tasmania says here). The quality of the scans is also quite variable – tight bindings cut off text, pages are skewed, and lighting is inconsistent. This means that the OCR processing is far from perfect. There will be names missing from the search index as a result of this. However, because you can search across all volumes at once, the database makes it easier to find people, as you can pick them up in one year and follow them through subsequent volumes, filling in any gaps.\nIt would be great if Libraries Tasmania would add a link to the database from their Directories and almanacs page. I’ve sent a couple of emails but haven’t received a reply. It seems odd that they’d link to commercial offerings like FindMyPast, but not to the free, community-developed version!",

          "description": "The Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench was updated last week. Over the last year I’ve been gradually updating notebooks to use version 3 of the Trove API, but when version 2 suddenly disappeared a couple of weeks ago I had to hurriedly pull everything together. The Trove newspapers section includes 23 notebooks and 6 datasets, so it’s not a small job. The changes include:\nupdated all notebooks to use version 3 of the Trove API\nremoved remaining datasets from the code repository and created dedicated data repositories for them, integrating them with Zenodo where appropriate\nadded metadata to all the notebooks – this is used to build an RO-Crate metadata file for the code repository\nupdated all the Python packages\nadded a voila.json file to configure Voilá\nNone of the functionality of the notebooks should have changed. There’s a slight difference in the Finding non-English newspapers in Trove notebook because the language detection library I was using is no longer maintained. I’ve swapped in py3langid and it seems to work well, though the results are a little different. Interestingly, where the previous library thought that bad OCR was ‘Maltese’, the new one detects it as ‘Latin’! There’s no change to the list of newspapers with non-English language content detected by the notebook.\n\r\nThe documentation pages have also been updated. The notebook pages are now built using data from the code repository’s RO-Crate file. They also include embedded HTML previews of the notebooks. If a notebook generates visualisations, the visualisations are usually included in the HTML, so you can explore the outputs without running the notebook – see, for example, the charts in Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state. Most of the dataset pages now include links to explore the contents using Datasette-Lite.\nI still have to generate RO-Crate files for all the data repositories, but I wanted to get the code stuff finished first.",

In effect, the workshop was also the launch of the Trove Data Guide, which I’ve been developing as part of the ARDC’s Community Data Lab. The ARDC sponsored today’s workshop and has provided bursaries to help five ECRs and HDRs participate in the conference’s digital history stream.\nThanks to everyone who came to the workshop. It was great to have so much interest in developing a critical understanding of Trove and thinking about new research uses for Trove data. If you couldn’t make it, the slides are available below. Like the Trove Data Guide, the GLAM Workbench and pretty much everything else I do, the slides are openly licensed so feel free to share and reuse if any of it is useful to you.\n\nNow I think I need a day off before I start thinking about the topics I’d still like to add to the Trove Data Guide…",

          "description": "The Trove Data Guide aims to help researchers understand, access, and use data from Trove. But just because it’s about ‘data’ doesn’t mean  you need to be able to code. To understand Trove data and its  possibilities for research, you first need to understand Trove itself –  its history, its structure, its assumptions, and its limits. This  knowledge is useful to any Trove user.\nFor example, all Trove users would benefit from knowing more about works and versions, or how to use the ‘simple’ search box for complex queries. There’s also an introduction to what’s in (and not in) the digitised newspapers, and similar overviews for other digitised content such as books, parliamentary papers, and oral histories.\n\r\nNumber of newspapers articles in Trove by publication year, showing the change from 2011 to 2022\nSeveral sections document the way the web interface works (or doesn’t work). There’s a field guide to the various interfaces and identifiers you might come across, and details of options for downloading data. The Trove Data Guide fills many gaps in the official Trove  documentation, so check here if you run into problems, or can’t figure  out how to achieve a particular task. Perhaps you were wondering how to download digitised images at their highest available resolution?\nFor people who are more comfortable with code there are plenty of  useful snippets and complete working examples. For example there are  sections that document how to get metadata, text, and images from newspapers, and other digitised resources. There are also a series of ‘HOW TO’ pages that describe more complex data access methods.\nBut what can you do with Trove data? The Trove Data Guide’s Pathways provide detailed tutorials that lead you step by step through examples  of packaging Trove data for use with other digital tools. Use these  examples as a starting point in planning your own projects.",

          "description": "For this part of the ARDC’s Community Data Lab project, I’ve been focusing in particular on adding a series of researcher pathways to the Trove Data Guide. These pathways link data from Trove to a variety of tools and approaches and include five detailed tutorials. The first four were:\nAnalysing keywords in Trove’s digitised newspapers\nWorking with a Trove collection in Tropy\nComparing manuscript collections in Mirador\nSharing a Trove List as a CollectionBuilder exhibition\nI’ve now added the fifth and final (for now) tutorial:\nCreate a layer in the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Placenames using metadata from Trove’s digitised maps\nAs has been the way in a lot of TDG development, this tutorial builds on and extends resources available through the GLAM Workbench. The Trove maps section of the GLAM Workbench already included a dataset of digitised maps and their coordinates, but for this tutorial I added a notebook that lets you create a subset of maps relating to a particular region. It does this by putting all the available map locations on world map. You then draw a rectangle on the map to select a region and display details of all the maps whose centre points fall within that region. It also displays links to download your new dataset as either a CSV or GeoJSON file.\n\r\nThe tutorial walks you through this process, then demonstrates how you can upload data from the CSV file to create a new layer in the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Placenames (GHAP).\n\r\nThis part of the Trove Data Guide project is now finished, but I’ll be continuing to add and refine content. If you have any suggestions for additional tutorials, feel free to add them to the ideas board (no promises though!).",

You’d like to display the contents of your list as an online exhibition for others to explore. But how? One possible approach is now documented in the Trove Data Guide. I’ve added a tutorial which walks through the process of using a GLAM Workbench notebook to extract and process data from a Trove List, before uploading it to CollectionBuilder to create an instant exhibition.\n\r\nCollectionBuilder creates online exhibitions using static web technologies. It provides a GitHub Pages template repository, so all you need to do to create an exhibition is upload your metadata and images to GitHub. The GLAM Workbench notebook gets your list data from the Trove API, and enriches it a bit to take advantage of CollectionBuilder’s built-in visualisations. For example, if there’s any digitised maps in your list, the notebook will try and extract their coordinates from the digitised map viewer and add them to the metadata so that CollectionViewer can display the location on a map. The notebook also downloads images of newspaper articles and other digitsed resources, and links them to the metadata, ready for upload.\nCheck out the tutorial: Sharing a Trove List as a CollectionBuilder exhibition",

It is characterized by both physical and psychological acts aimed at injuring or intimidating populations. In that sense, the word \"difficult\" in the title of this seminar refers to events in time that can be identified as acts of political violence.\nIn such circumstances, any attempt to do public history can certainly have its challenges. From ensuring participation, to working with silence, considering the mental health of both the participants and the project leaders, or anticipating the social impact before making this research public. \nDuring this seminar, Myriam Dalal will expand on the definition of the relatively new field of artistic research methodologies, which involves the creation of arts to help the practitioner/researcher improve, change or make their processes more effective, specific and articulated.\nMyriam Dalal will then discuss how artistic research methodologies can work with and help address some of the challenges of documenting “difficult” histories, based on examples from her research projects (1) tackling war, its photographic representation in the case of Lebanon and (2) migration/exile and the displacement/belonging experience in Luxembourg.\n \nWednesday, 15 January 2015\n14.00 - 15.00\n\nC²DH Open Space (4th floor Maison des Sciences humaines)\n15 January 2025\n  Public history\n  Methodology  Public History\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "The SNF (Swiss National Science Foundation) project ‘Horror – Game – Politics’ analysed a sample of 22 digital horror games in terms of their history of ideas. Project manager Eugen Pfister’s aim was to prove that digital games in general, and digital horror games in particular, frequently communicate discursive political statements. This happens both consciously, when developers intend to communicate a specific statement, and unconsciously in the form of myths as described by Roland Barthes. There has long been a consensus in research that a history of ideas and political history cannot be reconstructed solely on the basis of individual political texts. In democratic societies in particular, political communication takes place not only in parliaments and political essays, but also to a large extent in popular culture.\nDott. Ric. Dr. phil. Eugen Pfister is historian and political scientist. In particular, he researches the history of ideas and political history in digital games. He is currently leading the SNF-Sinergia project, ‘Swiss History of Games, Play and Game Design 1968-2000,’ with a team of 20 colleagues at four Swiss universities. Previously, he led the SNSF project ‘Horror-Game-Politics’ at the Bern University of the Arts. He studied at the Universität Wien and the Université Paris IV – Sorbonne. He wrote his PhD in the history of political communication in co-tutelle at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität Frankfurt am Main and the Università degli Studi di Trento. In 2015, he and 15 colleagues founded the Working Group for History and Digital Games (AKGWDS), which has since grown to over 300 members.\n \nTuesday, 19 November 2024\n\n17.00 - 18.30\nDH Lab, 1st floor Maison des Sciences humaines\n11, Porte des Sciences, L-4365 Esch-sur-Alzette\nand online\n \n\n\n19 November 2024\n  Public history\n  Media history\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "This lecture first examines historical and contemporary patterns of human and non-human mobilizations that emerge when certain archival collections gain attention—earning archival value—from official institutions, professional archivists, critical scholars, and researchers. In this context, it is essential to consider the distinct intentions of both mainstream and alternative agents involved in these collections. Additionally, the varying motivations, methods, and means of visibly activating and utilizing these archives must be noted. As these dynamics unfold, questions arise concerning the limitations of accessibility, competition over full ownership and representation, and the ongoing debate between quantity and quality in archival practices. Building on my experience with Shubra’s Archive—Egypt’s first neighborhood-based community archive—the second part of the lecture expands on these questions and debates by integrating vernacular archival practices informed and performed by local residents and researchers. The main argument is that the presence of a place that ethnographically archives and engages with its space in the here and now opens up innovative situated ethical, logistical, and social endeavors. These endeavors not only interrogate the value-making processes of archival collections but also highlight the ruses and risks of aspiring toward exhaustive and accessible archives.\n\nMina Ibrahim is a guest at the C²DH.\n \nTuesday, 22 October 2024\n14.00 - 15.00\n\"Aquarium\", 4th floor, Maison des Sciences humaines\nand online\n22 October 2024\n  Public history\n  Archives\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "In July 1843, after years of negotiation and resistance, the State of Ohio cast the last Native American tribe from its borders. Though the Wyandot reserved their legal right to remain until 1844, theft and land speculation by white settlers made staying in their homes untenable. Nearly 700 tribal citizens walked 240 kilometers from the Grand Reserve in Upper Sandusky to Cincinnati, Ohio. There, they boarded steamboats bound for unknown, unfamiliar lands in Kansas, over 1,150 kilometers away.\nOhio has forgotten about the Wyandot, as well as the larger story of their Removal and resistance. Wingo began a partnership with the the Cultural Division of the Wyandotte Nation in 2021 to reconstitute the Wyandot(te)’s legacy and repair Ohio’s historical amnesia. Their work consists of two (in-progress) community-based public history projects: the Wyandot Removal Trail and the Wyandot Heritage Digital Archive.\nThese projects are about reclamation as much as it is about Removal. Ohio, and the Midwest more broadly, mythologizes its past by laying claim to various freedoms: free from tyranny, free from slavery, and since 1843, also free from Indians. In coproducing this project, the Wyandotte are reclaiming control of their history, but how do they ensure the long term sustainability of these important resources?\n \nWednesday, 9 October 2024\n14.00 - 15.00\n\"Aquarium\", 3rd floor MSH\nand online\n9 October 2024\n  Public history\n  Public History\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

By going beyond traditional narratives of labour and economy, we seek to examine how these realms intersect with societal dynamics, identity formation, and community cohesion.\nMigration has long served as a conduit for the exchange and diffusion of sporting traditions, artistic expressions, and cultural identities across borders and continents. Similarly, sports, culture and arts serve as powerful mediums through which migrants navigate and negotiate their identities, fostering inclusion among migrant populations. This dynamic exchange between migration and what lies beyond work not only shapes the cultural landscapes of host nations but also enriches the global fabric of human experience.\nThe annual event is co-organised by the Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations Humaines (CDMH), a long-time AEMI member; the Ville de Dudelange and the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH).\n \nSee the detailed programme.\n \n25-28  September 2024\nTown Hall, Salle Nic Birtz, Dudelange\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/diddeleng_gemeng_web.jpg?itok=c1UWVcQk\n  34th AEMI (Association of European migration institutions) conference.\n  25 September 2024 to 28 September 2024\n  Contemporary history of Luxembourg  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Migration history  Transnationalism\n  Conferences\n  Published  \nPhoto by Cornischong [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons.",

          "description": "Many questions are currently being asked about the practice of history: archives are being transformed, tools have changed, as have the logics and players involved in disseminating historical research. How do we choose among the many paths open to us today? The “Taste of the archive in the digital age” project, carried out since 2017 with Frédéric Clavert, aimed in part to describe these new practices of history; it led to a reflection on the nature of the links that bind us to the archive. Certain parts of this documentation have become unstable, such as “family” archives, which have hitherto survived in attics or trunks, and are now flows that disappear at the same time as our smartphones and their photo albums. Around these questions gravitate “worlds”: archivists, the “public”, students, publishers... what specific contributions can historians make in this galaxy?\n \nMonday, 23 September 2024\n16.30 - 17.30\n\"Aquarium\", Maison des Sciences humaines\n11, Porte des Sciences\nL-4366 Luxembourg\nand online\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/carile_muller_full_width.jpg?itok=Jz0SRPJW\n  Talk by Caroline Muller, Université de Rennes.\n  23 September 2024\n  Public history\n  Archives  Digital hermeneutics  Digital methods  Digitisation\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Led by Myriam Dalal and Thomas Cauvin, researchers from the University of Luxembourg, this project uses oral history and art to give a voice to several Portuguese-speaking grandmothers residing in Esch-sur-Alzette, who have made this city their home.\nLOVÓ explores the personal stories of these remarkable women, weaving a link between the private and public spheres, and between the individual and the collective. These grandmothers play an essential role as bearers of intangible cultural heritage, tran…",

          "description": "Over the past several decades, great strides have been made to democratize public history. As one of the main cultural sites where public history is engaged, museums play a critical role in not only educating the public, but, increasingly, learning from the public about the past, and its significance in the present and future. Ongoing calls for deeper and more diverse forms of participation, power sharing, and collaboration have brought a wider range of perspectives and participants into the processes of producing history for public engagement. But museum practitioners’ engagement with children often remains stuck in outmoded, hierarchical dynamics that fail to recognize children’s capacities as contributors and collaborators in public historical work.

Across the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, an estimated 1,600 communities of color were destroyed by highway construction. Rondo was one of these neighborhoods, sacrificed to the asphalt as cities across the country weaponized their arteries by building “white roads through Black bedrooms.”\nMarvin Anderson remembers what the City of St. Paul did to his neighborhood, and he has made it his life’s mission to Remember Rondo. In 2015, Mr. Anderson and Rebecca Wingo joined forces to create RememberingRondo.org, a vibrant history hub with a community-based digital archive, a map of Rondo’s historic businesses, and much more.

But while historians and archivists share a common interest in archived information, their vision of material relevance and record-keeping occasionally differ. Additionally to this ancient divide, digital archiving has brought new challenges for both communities.\nIn this paper, I will first discuss conceptual continuity lines between analog and digital archiving of textual material at a general level. In a second step, I will examine both analog and digital archiving under the lens of their environmental footprint and the challenges it brings about in a context of resource shortage like the climate and biodiversity crisis.

Many of the epistemological and methodological questions we face today were already explored by previous generations.

Researchers still find it difficult to assess their own achievements from a historical perspective.

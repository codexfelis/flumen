I will give an overview of the data-intensive research methodology and discuss how methods, results, and data relate to each other and must be evaluated as parts of a whole: there is no such thing as a good method, nor is there a way to know if the results are good, without considering the data. I will discuss results as a window from which we can see our data, and how we can reason about the results of digital methods. I will also present the Change is Key! research program and describe our efforts to connect computational research with research questions from the humanities and social sciences.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Generations of scholars have proposed different theories explaining this expansion, which range from functionalist explanations, focusing on the provision of public goods, to conflict theories, emphasizing the role of class struggle or warfare. To quantitatively test these theories, I develop a general dynamical model, based on the theoretical framework of cultural macroevolution. Using this model and Seshat: Global History Databank I test 17 potential predictor variables proxying mechanisms suggested by major theories of sociopolitical complexity (and >100,000 combinations of these predictors). The best-fitting model indicates a strong causal role played by a combination of increasing agricultural productivity and invention/adoption of military technologies (most notably, iron weapons and cavalry in the first millennium BCE).\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

As language modeling has become more popular in the field of digital humanities as well, it has become apparent that this hurdle exactly can be very high for researchers to be able to make use of traditional language modeling methods. This contribution demonstrates how to improve the semantic quality of pre-trained word embeddings that have been built using a smaller English text corpus by incorporating structured knowledge (synonyms, antonyms, and hypernyms). Using the state-of-the-art method GLEN (Generalized Lexical ENtailment model, Glavaš and Vulić 2019), the experiment shows mixed results: While semantic similarity and lexical entailment show improvements, the performance for semantic relatedness falls behind in this setting. However, limiting the training data to only synonyms improves semantic relatedness as well, which implies that using more but diverse training data is not always advisable when wanting to improve the semantic quality of a smaller word embedding model, as this goal merges a variety of semantic aspects.\n Link to poster\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

However, with the help of computational techniques, words can be converted to numerical data and certain parts of a text can be examined on a large scale. Textual elements such as sentence length, word length and lexical diversity, which are associated by scholars on the one hand with the writing style of an individual author and on the other with the complexity of a text and the intended age of its readers, can thus be subjected to statistical evaluation. In this paper, data from little under 700 English and Dutch books written for different ages is analysed using a statistical linear mixed model. The results show that the textual elements studied are better qualified to detect the age of the intended reader of a text than the identity or age of the author.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Rising interest in the book, amplified by the success of the recent screen adaptation, has aroused curiosity regarding its realization. We use Rolling Delta and Rolling Classify to detect stylistic signals from each author as these methods reveal authorial takeovers. The same techniques are applied to compare the screenplay of the show to the novel. The results indicate that  Good Omens  resembles Pratchett’s work more closely. The screenplay is correctly attributed to Gaiman, its sole author, and the comparison reveals that Gaiman may have relied less on the source material over the course of the narrative arc.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Rather than computing relative frequencies as the number of occurrences of a given word divided by the total number of tokens in a text, I argue that a more efficient normalization factor is the total number of  relevant  tokens only. The notion of relevant words includes synonyms and, usually, a few dozen other words in some ways semantically similar to a word in question. To determine such a semantic background, one of word embedding models can be used. The proposed method outperforms classical most-frequent-word approaches substantially, usually by a few percentage points depending on the input settings.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Accordingly, a lot of research has been dedicated to the documentation of tools as well as to the analysis of their impact from an epistemological perspective. In this paper we propose a binary and a multi-class classification approach to detect and classify tools. The approach builds on state-of-the-art neural language models. We test our model on two different corpora and report the results for different parameter configurations in two consecutive experiments. In the end, we demonstrate how the models can be used for actual tool detection and tool classification tasks in a large corpus of DH journals.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

The basic   unit are scenes and the motif repertoire instantiated in the scene. The motif repertoire   consists of three sets of (closely related) elements: character stereotypes, types of   verbal actions and action types. It is assumed that the motif repertoire is highly   dependent on the corpus which is analyzed, in our case a corpus of romance and horror   novels published as pulp fiction. The resulting information is represented in a temporal   graph which in turn is used to compute relevant information on the scenes and   characters. Scenes are also characterized by their valence and their arousal value. A second representation which offers with a topic model of the direct speech and the  narrative text a simple proxy for the types of verbal actions and the action types is also created. To assess the ability of these information structures to indicate changes   in the temporal structures three evaluation methods are used based on artificial data.   We can confirm that a very abstract representation of the plot is able to do so, but   contrary to our expectations the more information-rich model which makes use of the   topic model is not better in doing so. The main contribution of this paper is its   attempt to integrate different research proposals into one integral model. We offer a   descriptive framework and a proposal for the formal model of plot, which makes it   possible to identify research problems and align existing approaches.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

A large body of scholarship known as ``thing theory’’ has attempted to understand the function of fictional things within literature mostly by focusing on small case studies. We provide the first-ever estimates of the distribution of different types of things in English-language fiction over the past two centuries along with experiments to model their semantic identity. Our findings suggest that the most common fictional things are structural in nature, functioning akin to narrative props. We conclude by showing how these findings pose problems for inherited theories of fictional things and propose an alternative theoretical framework, embodied cognition, as a way of understanding the predominance of structural things.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

This paper presents a study that uses literary reviews as a proxy for aesthetic judgment in order to identify systematic components that can be attributed to bias. Specifically, we find that judgments of literary quality differ across media types and display a gender bias. In newspapers, male reviewers have a same-gender preference while female reviewers show an opposite–gender preference. On the other hand, in the blogosphere female reviewers prefer female authors. While alternative accounts exist of this apparent gender disparity, we argue that it reflects a cultural gender antagonism that is necessary to take into account when doing computational assessment of aesthetics.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

It derives from the broader otaku culture, which is also associated with video games, manga, cosplay, anime, and other forms of Japanese popular culture. Though the light novel lacks the global reach of some of these other genres, such as manga and anime, it nonetheless attracts millions of readers across a range of gender and age groups. While distinct subgenres of the light novel have emerged, such as romance, adventure, horror, and harem, issues of gender stereotyping, power imbalances and other forms of inequality remain strongly entrenched. These issues can be attributed to how otaku culture is rooted in heterosexual male desire. This paper offers a quantitative assessment of these issues of gender inequality. We analyze 290 light novels, scraped from the Baka-Tsuki Translation Community Wiki, in terms of the power relationships between female and male characters as they evolve over the course of each novel. We find patterns consistent with issues of gender stereotyping and power differentials. More specifically, we find that female characters consistently wield less power than male characters, especially toward the end of each novel. We find some variation in specific subgenres. We conclude with close readings of two light novels, demonstrating how a power frames approach to analyzing gender stereotypes in otaku culture augments existing work on the subject.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

However it is not a straightforward task, as genre labels can be ambiguous and subject to temporal change, and moreoever many books consist of mixed or miscellaneous genres. In this paper we describe a work-in-progress method by which genre predictions can be used to determine longer sequences of genre change within books, which we test out with visualisations of some hand-picked texts. We apply state-of-the-art methods to the task, including a BERT-based transformer and character-level Perceiver model, both pre-trained on a large collection of eighteenth century works (ECCO), using a new set of hand-annotated documents created to reflect historical divisions. Results show that both models perform significantly better than a linear baseline, particularly when ECCO-BERT is combined with tfidf features, though for this task the character-level model provides no obvious advantage. Initial evaluation of the genre sequence method shows it may in the future be useful in determining and dividing the multiple genres of miscellaneous and hybrid historical texts.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Outside of classical meters, describing the metrical structure of a poem in a large corpus requires expertise and a shared scientific theory. In a situation when both components are lacking, alternative and continuous measures of regularity can be envisioned. This paper focuses on poetic rhythm to propose a simple entropy-based measure for poem regularity using counts of non-stressed intervals. The measure is validated using subsets of a well-annotated Russian poetic corpus, prose, and quasi-poems (prose chopped into lines). The regularity measure is able to detect a clear difference between various organizational principles of texts: average entropy rises when moving from accentual-syllabic meters to accentual variations to free verse and prose. Interval probabilities, when taken as a vector of features, also allow for classification at the level of individual poems. This paper argues that distinguishing between meter as a cultural idea and rhythm as an empirical sequence of sounds can lead to better understanding of form recognition and prosodic annotation problems.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Discussed topics varied from records of price fluctuations to local politics, and from weather reports to remarkable gossip. What we do not know yet, is to what extent times of conflict and crises influenced the way in which people dealt with information. We have applied methods from information theory – dynamics in word usage and measures of relative entropy such as  novelty  and  resonance  – to a corpus of early modern chronicles from the Low Countries (1500–1820) to provide more insight in the way early modern people were coping with information during impactful events. We detect three peaks in the novelty signal, which coincide with times of political uncertainty in the Northern and Southern Netherlands. Topic distributions provided by Top2Vec show that during these times, chroniclers tend to write more and more extensively about an increased variation of topics.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Estimating the Size of the Dutch East India Company Using an Unseen Species Model\nAbstract: Historians base their inquiries on the sources that are available to them. However, not all sources that are relevant to the historian’s inquiry may have survived the test of time. Consequently, the resulting data can be biased in unknown ways, possibly skewing analyses. This paper deals with the Dutch East India Company its digitized ledgers of contracts. We apply an unseen species model, a method from ecology, to estimate the  actual  number of unique seafarers contracted. We find that the lower bound of actual seafarers is much higher than what the remaining contracts indicate: at least, thirty-six percent of the seafarers is unknown. Moreover, we find that even in periods when few records survived, we can still credibly estimate a lower bound on the unique number of seafarers.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

In this paper, we propose a unified, formal framework for two fundamental questions in the study of the transmission of texts: how much was lost or preserved from all works of the past, and why do their genealogies (their \"phylogenetic trees’‘) present the very peculiar shapes that we observe or, more precisely, reconstruct? We argue here that these questions share similarities to those encountered in evolutionary biology, and can be described in terms of \"genetic’’ drift and \"natural’’ selection.  Through agent-based models, we show that such properties as have been observed by philologists since the 1800s can be simulated, and confronted to data gathered for ancient and medieval texts across Europe, in order to obtain plausible estimations of the number of works and manuscripts that existed and were lost.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Correlating the bottom-up, linguistic feature driven clustering with text type distinctions (medium and register) enables us to quantify the influence of individual author choice and medium/register conventions on variable linguistic phenomena. Our pilot study applies the method to German particles and intensifiers in a multimedia corpus, annotated for register. We show that German particles and intensifiers differ across both register and medium. The clustering based on the linguistic features most closely corresponds to the medium distinction, while the stratification into registers is reflected to a lesser extent.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

To do this, we used Bert Emotion to assign probability scores for eight different emotions to each text in a time series of 43 million Danish tweets from 2019-2022. We find that variance in the information signals novelty and resonance reliably identify seasonal shifts in posting behavior, particularly around the Christmas holiday season, whereas variance in  the distribution of emotion scores corresponds to more local events such as major inflection points in the Covid-19 pandemic in Denmark. This work in progress suggests that emotion scores are a useful tool for diagnosing shifts in the baseline information state of social media platforms such as Twitter, and for understanding how social media systems respond to both predictable and unexpected external events.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Governmental decisions, notarial deeds and official charters often contain fixed expressions to ensure that the same legal aspects in different documents had the same interpretation.  Such formulaic expressions can be used to identify specific elements of a document. For instance, a deed has different formulas to indicate whether it concerns the sale of property or the transferal of rights.  In this paper we explore formulas as a methodological devise to structure the text of an administrative corpus and make the information contained in it better accessible. We use a data-driven method to detect potential formulaic expressions in historical corpora, that can deal with spelling variation and change and recognition errors introduced in the digitisation process. We apply this exploratory technique on a corpus of almost 300,000 eighteenth-century resolutions of the States General of the Dutch Republic and find many formulaic expressions that capture relationships between the political actors involved and the decisions that were made. A first analysis suggests that many formulas can be used to add metadata to individual resolutions on various elements of the proposals and decisions that are part of each resolution.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

By means of an experiment on the historical ARCHER corpus, we show that lexical diversity at the level of functional groups is less sensitive to orthographic variation, and provides insight into an important and often disregarded dimension of vocabulary diversity in textual data.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Increasingly, the perceived value of goods was not only determined by the intrinsic quality of the goods, but also by the socio-commercial discourse used to characterise them. Linguistic modifiers, such as adjectives, must have played an important role in this process – reflecting these socio-economical trends in text while also reinforcing them. Here, we focus on a diachronic corpus of over 5,000 pages of London auction advertisement pages, digitised via automated transcription and divided across four sample periods between 1742-1829. Prime methodological challenges include: (1) the noisiness of the available data because of imperfect transcription; (2) the coarseness of the available time stamps, and (3) the lack of suitable NLP software, such as lemmatizers or (shallow) syntactic parsers. Through the use of word embeddings, we try to alleviate the issue of spelling variation with reasonable success. We find that, over time, subjective or ‘evaluative’ modifiers have become more prominent in these advertisements than their objective or ‘descriptive’ counterparts – but there are different temporal patterns for different types of advertised objects\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Fine-tuning a BERT Model to Explore a Stylistic Phenomenon\nAbstract: The narrative work of well-known Italian author Italo Calvino (1923-1985) features a phenomenon that literary critics refer to as ``dubitative text’': this stylistic device consciously hinders the narrative progression of a story, by questioning its own content. We report on an attempt to model the presence of dubitative text in Calvino’s fictional oeuvre and examine whether this model can also be used to retrieve dubitative instances in his essayistic oeuvre. We hypothesize that precisely the category of the dubitative text yields interesting points of intersection between both writing modes. We fine-tuned a BERT model based on a manually annotated dataset and report inter-annotator scores. We situate our findings and model criticism in the current landscape of Calvino scholarship.

Also, new Latin comedies are again written in quantities never seen before (at least 10,000 works published 1500 to 1800 are known). The authors themselves, within the game of literary imitation (the process of  imitatio), start to mimic the style of ancient authors, and Terence’s dramas in particular were considered the prime sources of reuse for many decades.   Via a case study “the reception of Terence’s  Eunuchus  in Early Modern literature”, we take a deep dive into the mechanisms of literary imitation. Our analysis is based on four comedy corpora in Latin, Italian, French and English, spanning roughly 3 centuries (1400-1700). To assess the problem of language shift and multi-language inter-corpora analysis, we base our experiments on translations of the  Eunuchus , one for each sub-corpus. Through the use of tools drawn from the field of Stylometry, we address the topic of text reuse and textual similarities between Terence’s text and Early-Modern corpora to get a better grasp on the internal fluctuations of the imitation game between Early Modern and Classical authors.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Combining these perspectives, in this work we study character networks extracted from a text corpus of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Legendarium. We show that this perspective helps us to analyse and visualise the narrative style that characterises Tolkien’s works. Addressing character classification, embedding and co-occurrence prediction, we further investigate the advantages of state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks over a popular word embedding method.

We present a study on the relation between sentiment fractality and literary appreciation by testing the hypothesis that fairy tales with a good balance between unpredictability and excessive self-similarity in their sentiment narrative arcs tend to be more popular and more appreciated by audiences of readers. In short, we perform a correlation study of the degree of fractality of the fairy tales of the Grimm brothers and their current appreciation as measured by their Goodreads scores. Moreover, we look at the popularity of these fairy tales through time, determining which ones have come to form a strong “internal canon” in the corpus of the authors and which one have fallen into relative obscurity.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

We first manually annotated French and Spanish words appearing in 12,000-word text samples by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway using a TEI tag. We then split the tagged sample texts into four groups of n-grams, from unigram to tetragram, and compared the accuracy of five LI packages on correctly identifying the language of the tagged foreign-language snippets. We report that, of the packages tested, Fasttext proved most accurate for this task overall, but that methodological questions and future work remain.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

In this short paper, we present an approach to bridge the gap between existing algorithms and humanistically driven annotations through a case study in which we create an algorithm to detect and and classify portrait photography. We apply this method to a collection of about 40,000 photographs and present a preliminary analysis of the constructed data. The work  is part of the larger ongoing study that applies computer vision to the computational analysis of over a million U.S. documentary photographs from the early twentieth century.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

With highly complex layouts and mixed scripts, scholarly commentaries are text-heavy documents which remain challenging for state-of-the-art models. Their layout considerably varies across editions and their most important regions are mainly defined by semantic rather than graphical characteristics such as position or appearance. This setting calls for a comparison between textual, visual and hybrid approaches. We therefore assess the performances of two transformers (LayoutLMv3 and RoBERTa) and an objection-detection network (YOLOv5). If results show a clear advantage in favor of the latter, we also list several caveats to this finding. In addition to our experiments, we release a dataset of ca. 300 annotated pages sampled from 19th  century commentaries.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

These images are widely reproduced and recognised and can therefore be considered memorable. A question that arises given such images is whether the memorability of iconic images is intrinsic or whether it is shaped. In this work we analyse the memorability of iconic images by means of computational  techniques that are specifically designed to measure the intrinsic memorability of images. To judge whether iconic images are inherently more memorable we establish two baselines based on datasets of diverse imagery and of newspaper imagery. Our findings show that iconic images are not more memorable than modern day newspaper imagery or when compared to a diverse set of everyday images. In fact, by and large many of the iconic images analysed score on the low end of the memorability spectrum. Additionally, we explore the variation in memorability of reproductions of iconic images  and find that certain images have been edited resulting in higher memorability scores,  but that the images by and large are reproduced with memorability close to the original.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Getting models robust to scribal and material changes is a necessary step for specific data mining tasks. However, evaluation of HTR results requires ground truth to compare prediction statistically. In the context of modern languages, successful attempts to evaluate quality have been done using lexical features or n-grams. This, however, proves difficult in the context of spelling variation that both Old French and Latin have, even more so in the context of sometime heavily abbreviated manuscripts. We propose a new method based on deep learning where we attempt to categorize each line error rate into four error rate ranges ( 0 < 10 %  < 25  %  < 50 %  < 100 % ) using three different encoder (GRU with Attention, BiLSTM, TextCNN). To train these models, we propose a new dataset engineering approach using early stopped model, as an alternative to rule-based fake predictions. Our model largely outperforms the n-gram approach. We also provide an example application to qualitatively analyse our classifier, using classification on new prediction on a sample of 1,800 manuscripts ranging from the 9th century to the 15th.\n Link to paper\n\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

          "description": "Following our last post focusing on Critical Discourse Analysis, today we highlight an automated document enrichment pipeline for automated interview coding, proposed by Ajda Pretnar Žagar, Nikola Ðukic´, Rajko Muršic in their paper presented at the Conference on Language Technologies & Digital Humanities, Ljubljana 2022.  As described in the \"Essential Guide to Coding Qualitative Data\" (https://delvetool.com/guide), one of the main field of application of such a procedure is Ethnography, but not only.\n\nThanks to qualitative data coding it is possible to enrich texts through adding labels and descriptions to specific passages, that are generally pinpointed by means of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis softwares (CAQDAS). This can be valid for several fields of applications, from the humanities to biology, from sociology to medicine.\n﻿In their paper, Pretnar Žagar, Ðukic´  and Muršicˇ illustrate how relying on a couple of taxonomies (or onthologies) already known in anthropological studies may represent an asset to automatize and hasten the process of data labelling. These taxonomies are the Outline of Cultural Materials (OCM) and the ETSEO (acronym for Ethnological Topography of Slovenian Ethnic Territory) systematics. In both cases we deal with taxonomies elaborated and applied in ethnographic research in order to organize and better analyze concepts and categories related to human cultures and traditions.\n\n[Click ‘Read more’ for the full post!]",

Stephanie Vie and Jennifer deWinter explain some of the tools digital humanists can use for critical discourse analysis and visualization of data collected from social media platforms. Although not all the tools they mention are open source, the majority of them have free to use or freemium versions, including AntConc, a free-to-use concordancing tool, or several Twitter data visualisation tools such as Tweeps map or Tweetstats.\n\nEven though the video does not provide just-as-good open source alternatives to Atlas.ti or MAXQDA (an obviously a recurrent question or shortcoming that is recurrently discussed on OpenMethods), it sets an excellent example for how to introduce tool criticism in the classroom alongside introduction to certain Digital Humanities Tools. After briefly touching upon both advantages and disadvantages of each tool, they encourage their audience (students in Digital Humanities study programs) to pilot each of them by using the same data-set and not only compare their results but also reflect on the epistemic processes in-between.\n\nSharing the video on Humanities Commons with stable archiving, DOI and rich metadata is among the best things that could happen to teaching resources of all kinds.",

The paper captures the procedure that has applied by starting from an overview about the application of ontologies to music, as well as of the so- called 'façade-based' approach to knowledge graphs, which is at the core of the SPARQL Anything software. Then, it moves to an illustration of the passages involved (i.e., melody extraction, N-grams extraction, N-grams analysis and exploitation\nof the Music Notation Ontology). Finally, it provides some considerations regarding the result of the experiment in terms of effectiveness of the queries' performance. In conclusion, the authors highlight how further studies in the field may cast an increasingly brighter light on the application of semantic-oriented methods and techniques to computational musicology. \n[Click ‘Read more’ for the full post!]",

This sets the stage for the second part that consists of 5 case studies (Statistics Essentials: WhoReads Novels? ; Introduction to Probability ; Narrating with Maps ; Stylometry and the Voice of Hildegard ; A Topic Model of United States Supreme Court Opinions, 1900–2000 ) showcasing how to draw meaningful insights from data using quantitative methods. Each chapter contains executable Python codes and ends with exercises ranging from easier drills to more creative and complex possibilities to adapt the apply and adopt the newly acquired knowledge to their own research problems.\n\nThe book exhibits best practices in how to make digital scholarship available in an open, sustainable ad digital-native manner, coming in different layers that are firmly interlinked with each other. Published with Princeton University Press in 2021, hardcopies are also available, but more importantly, the digital version is an  Open Access Jupyter notebook that can be read in multiple environments and formats (.md and .pdf). The documentation, coda and data materials are available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/3560761#.Y3tCcn3MJD9).

Recent publications taking advantage of such digital affordances have included monographs, enhanced journals, hybrid digital & print projects, as well as podcasts. How are these projects designed and developed to be sustainable, discoverable, and accessible in the long term? Who is publishing them? And how can graduate students and early career scholars acquire the skills and/or find support to develop digital publications? \nThis presentation will address how academic publishers are approaching multimodal born-digital and hybrid publications, as well as how libraries are supporting contemporary digital publishing methods. In particular it will introduce the range of recent scholarly digital publications and the University Presses actively seeking proposals. It will also touch on considerations for developing a digital publication, including the DH skill set learning curve, pitching a project to an editor, writing for a public audience, platforms, preservation, and accessibility, and resources for getting started.\n\n\nSubtitle: \n\nMultimodal Digital Scholarship\n\n\nImage for Left Column:",

(See February’s update for more recent changes…)\nGeneral developments\nAfter many months of work, all thirteen Trove repositories within the GLAM Workbench have been updated to include standard configurations, integrations, and basic tests. This will make ongoing development and maintenance much easier. Docker images of every repository are now built automatically whenever the code changes. These images can be used across multiple computing environments, including cloud services such as Binder, Nectar, and Reclaim Cloud, as well on a local computer. This means users have more options for running the notebooks within a consistent, pre-configured, and tested environment.\nWith all the Trove repositories …",

I’m hoping to add some more content in the coming months, but for now I just did a bit of maintenance – updating Python packages and config files, including tests, and setting up automated builds of Docker containers. The documentation pages have also had a bit of a refresh.

I ended up trying to find references to countries in a collection of 90,000 OCRd books. Of course I struck a few problems along the way, and didn’t get nearly as much done as I’d hoped, but that was really part of the point – to find the problems and explore the possibilities.

Edited by Paul Ashton and Paula Hamilton, the book ‘explores the complex, multi-roomed house of Australian history’, exploring academic, school, and public history, the impact of digital technologies, and the relationship of history to memory, social justice, politics, and cultural practice.\nMy chapter ‘Digital revolutions: The limits and affordances of online collections’ looks at how digitisation of GLAM collections has (and hasn’t) changed historical practice:\nAs the COVID lockdowns in 2020 emphasised, the online availability of  primary source materials makes historical research possible even when  access to the originals is limited. But the undoubted convenience of  being able to browse 200 years worth of newspapers at home masks other  issues that historians have been slow to acknowledge and address. How do we discover relevant resources? What gets digitised and why? How can  researchers use these collections to ask new types of questions? After more than 25 years, the web has its own history. What problems and  possibilities has it brought to the way we understand the past?\nIt’s available as a green open access preprint on Zenodo.",

Familiar to millions of users worldwide and therefore conceptualised as public spaces, these games may depict real-world historical environments, such as the sceneries in Assassin's Creed, the maps in Europa Universalis, or the mechanisms of Civilization. Alternatively, they may deconstruct fictional or virtual pasts, as seen in Shadow of the Colossus, or combine both approaches, like in Siberia.\nJoanna Wojdon is Professor of History at the University of Wrocław, Poland, member of the Steering Committee of the International Federation for Public History, co-organizer of the Public History Summer School in Wrocław, editor of Public History in Poland (Routledge, 2021) and co-editor, with Dorota Wiśniewska, of Public in Public History (Routledge, 2021).

What does being a historian of technologies, infrastructures, or networks imply, and is there a singularity regarding sources and archives? It is this relationship to the archives, to the sources, to the historical material at large, to the spatialities, and materialities as well, that this conference invites us to question.\nThe issue of “Surprising Sources” can be understood in two ways: first by reflecting on a source that is surprising in its form (use of a series of stamps, unpublished data, a natively digital archive, material traces like abandoned factory, pipes, etc.), and second by presenting a source that is surprising in its content…",

          "description": "The Digital Turn had promised to ‘free’ knowledge from subjectivity. But as the reassuring promises of objectivity and accuracy based on notions of quantitative, computational, automated, and unsupervised turned out to be illusory, is digital scholarship even more biased than the interpretative act itself? As there is no such a thing as ‘neutral data’ or ‘objective methods’, what is now the role of the digital scholar? Is Critical Digital Humanities the answer?\nIn this presentation, Lorella Viola will first analyse many of the different ways in which reality has been transformed by technology: the pervasive adoption of big data, the fetishisation of algorithms and automation, the digitisation of education and research. She will argue that the full digitisation of society, accelerated by th…",

          "description": "In this research seminar, we will discuss the ongoing extraction of data from the administrative archives of Dudelange, relying on an automated transcription, with layout detection and the automated extraction of temporal and spatial information from these sources to create historical maps.\nThe city of Dudelange has entered a partnership with the C²DH, for which they shared their residential cards. These administrative forms contain information on the population movements in and out of the city. These are being scanned and transcribed.\nFor the transcription, the project uses Transkribus to restitute not only the textual content of these administrative forms but also their structure, e.g., for each field, a tag is attached. Secondly, for the blocs of texts, a script to detect place and time information is being developed internally. All these steps should lead up to the structuration before import of the data to be visualised on a map and open these rich collections for further analysis, on the history of migration, housing, public health etc.\nWe invite all interested persons to join the discussion on how to improve this pipeline and share other potential uses for the extracted material. \n \nWednesday, 19 April 2023\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space\nMaison des Sciences humaines, 4th floor\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/logo_research_seminars_content_list.png?itok=r2xDOs_L\n  Research seminar with Estelle Bunout.\n  19 April 2023\n  Contemporary history of Luxembourg\n  Archives  Data Science  Digital methods  Digitisation  Visualisation\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

However, even though women played a vital part in the European project launched after the Second World War, their role has yet to be fully explored. Women tended to remain in the background until they began to be more readily accepted, from the mid-1970 onwards, as political leaders, particularly following the first European elections by direct universal suffrage (1979) and the appointment of the first female European Commissioner (1989).

And how do historians represent these structures by the design of their publications?\nTraditional text formats seem to favor the representation of linear progression: Text flows from beginning to end, mostly sequentially. Chapters and sections serve as means of hierarchization. This structure resembles the flow of time in history, on the one hand, and the logical ‘architecture’ of academic sense-making, on the other hand. However, complex conceptions of history like global entanglements, time layers, or spatial history resist the linear logic of the text.

          "description": "The office building is one of quintessential architectural typologies of the twentieth century. Without any doubt, moreover, “the office” is one of the social institutions that has contributed to the formation and definition of modernity in the broad sense. Yet remarkably, historical research has only recently begun to pick up on the office building and its corresponding “office cultures”. In this seminar, I will explore some recent historiographical approaches, including Delphine Gardey’s notion of the office building as a “technical-organisational complex”. For Gardey, the office is characterised by an interplay of architectural/technical infrastructures (the “hardware”) on the one hand, and normative ideas on the occupants’ behaviour (the “software”) on the other hand. This combined focus on both architecture and its managerial determinants is also at the heart of the ongoing BUREU project. \nHaving started in 2022, BUREU is a transnational research project (C²DH / University of Leuven) that aims to expand our knowledge of office buildings, their planning, and their usage. It does this through a series of case studies on EU institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg. This way, BUREU also aims to contribute to existing scholarship on “hidden integration” processes in Europe.

More than that, it had no competence to act in the field of public health, which had remained the prerogative of the member states since the beginning of the European integration. But as all member states detected some cases in the following months or years, and as the fear of a deadly pandemic rose in the European public opinion, the EC, which was simultaneously going through a new dynamic of integration (leading to the enlargements of 1982 and 1986, to the Single European Act in 1987, and to the Maastricht Treaty in 1992), was under pressure to “do something” and…",

Pixelvetica provided a report on the current state of preservation in Switzerland, including guidelines aimed at politicians, heritage institutions, or game developers. We will present and discuss the conclusions from this report. Confederatio Ludens, a joint project of four universities (HKB, UNIBE, ZHdK, UNIL), will start in February 2023 and addresses a gap in the understanding of the Swiss video game industry and its cultural impact in the 20th Century. This project draws on existing research and will present and discuss the methodological challenges we are facing, for example in terms of oral history (many key actors are still alive), analysis of source code, and digital archiving. The talk will also introduce the field of game studies and its importance in understanding the broader cultural and societal context of video games.\nYannick Rochat is a professor assistant in game studies at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland (Department of Language and Information Sciences, Faculty of Arts). His research activities are dedicated to the study of video game and computer heritage in Switzerland as well as the use of video games for teaching.

The federal government planned to pass a law making all Native Americans citizens of the United States. The surveys would measure individual family’s readiness for citizenship.

          "description": "The deportation of Crimean Tatars was a state-organized and forcible eviction of Crimean Tatars people that was ordered by Joseph Stalin as a form of collective punishment in 1944. It was supposed to completely remove the Crimean Tatar nationality from the demographic map of the world. It ruined the traditional way of life, social structure, and cultural institutes of Crimean Tatars. Indeed, Crimean Tatars were supposed to assimilate in exile. As a result of state-sponsored violence, Crimean Tatars became a nation in exile. After Stalin's death they did not receive the right to return to Crimea and renew their autonomy, like most \"punished peoples.\" However, Crimean Tatars escaped the fate and managed to reshape their identity. Moreover, despite the ban, Crimean Tatars tried to return to their homeland during the Soviet era.\nIn the presentation the question \"How did Crimean Tatars returnees dealt with 'homecoming'?\" will be answered. Studying the Crimean Tatars' return contribute significantly not only to the history of Crimean Tatars, moreover, it is important for the understanding of reverse migration process in migration studies. The research, foremost, is based on oral history interviews. So the special attention will be paid to doing Oral History in Crimea.\n \n\n\n \nA historian of Crimean Tatars, Martin-Oleksandr Kisly (History Department of National university of Kyiv-Mohyla academy) holds a Candidate of Science degree, having defended a dissertation entitled \"Crimean Tatars’ Return to the Homeland in 1956–1989\".

This talk will use examples drawn from the Living with Machines project, a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute and British Library with partner universities, to consider this question. Living with Machines is developing digital history and data science methods to explore vast digitised corpora of historical collections from the long 19th century. Crowdsourcing was built into the project from the very beginning, both as a form of public engagement and a method for data collection. Participants comments and survey results provide insights into their experiences reading and annotating historical newspaper articles.\nBiography\nDr Mia Ridge is the British Library’s Digital Cura…",

Il est généralement admis qu’en 1940 3.500 à 4.000 personnes de confession israélite vivaient au Luxembourg, des citoyens luxembourgeois, mais aussi un grand nombre de juifs de nationalité étrangère ou apatrides. Environ 3.000 juifs quitteront le Luxembourg entre le 10 mai 1940 et la veille du premier convoi de déportation en Europe de l’Est, le 15 octobre 1941. L’occupation allemande au 10 mai 1940 signifia la fin de l’Etat de droit luxembourgeois.

          "description": "Mixed Reality, in its many forms, is generally characterised by its audiovisual, spatial and immersive nature, blending virtual content with elements of physical reality into an arrangement that allows users to physically walk through and interact with the resulting three-dimensional hybrid space. Due to these qualities cultural institutions worldwide are experimenting with new ways of communicating, reviving and preserving cultural heritage. The session will show how adapting a body-based design approach that goes beyond the audiovisual can bring about new forms of learning and understanding history.\nKatharina Tillmanns is a researcher, designer and lecturer for interactive immersive media at TH Köln (https://colognegamelab.de). A former co-president of the Games for Change Europe network and director of the Notgames Fest, she has been exploring and promoting the expressive qualities of games and other playful media as a means of art and activism for the past 12+ years. Currently Katharina is focusing on her dissertation research, which examines multi-sensory learning in the context of mixed reality environments.\n \n \nMonday, 12 December 2022\n17.00 – 18:30\nMaison du Savoir.

The interest in AI-generated language data and human-machine interaction is significant, underpinned by extensive coverage in the media. However, many of the discussions tend to focus on the chatbots’ ability to produce content, and their potential uses in the future. Few address the specific issues relevant to those working with digital language resources.  \nCLARIN’s legal experts - the CLARIN Legal and Ethical Issues Committee, or CLIC - made this topic the focus of the latest CLARIN Café. Entitled 'Do Chatbots Dream of Copyright?' Copyright in AI-generated Language Data, the Café brought together a group of experts from different fields in order to explore the legal implications of working with or using AI-generated texts, and specifically whether these texts can—and should—be protected by copyright.\nRead the full impact story here. \n\n      Karina Berger\n 18 April 2023",

I started to work for CLARIN in the summer of 2015, the beginning of a journey that brought many moments of discovery, the unravelling of complexity, achievements, innovation and growth. Language matters, and therefore language resources matter. So leading the mission of making them findable and accessible, and pointing out the potential for impact along many dimensions of the richness that has been collected, annotated and deposited, in growing volumes and for a wide diversity of languages, has been a deeply rewarding role. The journey also brought many moments of personal inspiration and satisfaction, not least because of the many moments of warm collegial collaboration and exchange.\nAnd the future? The landscape of research infrastructures in which CLARIN is positioned is very dynamic and there always seem to be new horizons. But even though some of the envisaged scenarios for the future may never materialise, I trust that there will be a multitude of ways in which another generation of experts can show the way for CLARIN to be able to adapt to new conditions and policy frameworks. Being a crucial building block for any new stage that will result from the evolutionary path taken, that is what I wish for CLARIN. And of course that it can continue its role in enhancing the options for exploring the cultural and societal diversity that is reflected in language.

          "description": "This project considers the place of food production and consumption in Italian-Canadian culture, examining cuisine as one of the defining traits of cultural identity for Italian immigrants that settled within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) over the past one hundred years. It begins with an overview of the history of Italian immigration to Toronto and key neighbourhoods built and transformed by this diaspora, including the establishment of landmark food businesses that persist to this day. Using a sociocultural, historical lens, the project further highlights the impact and contributions of the Italian community on Toronto’s food industry, tracing the growth and enduring legacies of restaurants in the face of cultural demographic shifts towards the turn of the century. This project further outlines the importance of recognizing and preserving the culinary traditions of diasporas, particularly in times of crises that impact local businesses and threaten to erase the cultural footprint of immigrant communities.",

          "description": "Dear CHR community,\nWe, together with CLS INFRA team, seek for your help and want to invite you to participate in the quick survey to map the current landscape and future directions in teaching computational literary studies!\nCLS INFRA project aims to  create unified and easy access to a wide range of European and national infrastructures for the Computational Literary Studies community. This includes: connecting the resources and establishing standardized access to them, providing training environments and consolidating research networks, promoting the theoretical considerations for computational work on literature.\nWith this survey, CLS INFRA is looking for your help to find out which areas of research you would like to see represented in learning the computational and research skills necessary for data-driven studies of literature. Everyone with interest in the subject is invited to partake in the survey, regardless of experience level. The survey takes about 10-15 minutes to complete and you will help us shape the future of computational literary studies! \nThe results of this survey will be used to supplement the current offer in training and schooling: CLS INFRA is organizing a series of Training Schools in the directions outlined by the research community.\nTake me to the survey.\nThanks in advance for your time – and for forwarding the survey to those who might be interested!\nBest wishes on behalf of the CLS INFRA project team,\nWeb\nTwitter\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

At the same time, working groups such as the CEI have been considering the possibilities of a standard to encode medieval and early modern charters in XML, inserting diplomatics’ concepts and charter-specific markup into the framework of the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines.

We are looking for participants to join us in a day of making, research and reflection with the physical materials that underpin AI systems. Those that are conventionally considered to ‘make’ AI through the design of AI systems are largely divorced from AI’s materiality and the craft of making AI. We hope to push participants beyond the theoretical knowing of AI materiality to tactile knowing through a practice-based approach to ‘making’ AI. Reorienting the focus of AI to materials and the supply chain as sites of creative intervention could leverage the potential of sensory, tactile experiences to spur re-imaginations of AI technologies and infrastructures.\nhttps://aiyesterday.com/ACM-C-C-Workshop\n \nProject Team: Margaret McGrath, Nancy Salem, Laurel Boxall\nFunders: TORCH-Minderoo Fund in AI Governance",

          "description": "Motifs in folktales and myths have been identified and articulated by scholars, and the computational identification and discovery of such motifs is an area of ongoing research. Achieving this goal means meeting scientific requirements (that methods be comparable and replicable) and requirements for collaboration (that multi-disciplinary teams can reliably access data). To support those requirements, access to consistent reference datasets is needed. Unfortunately, these datasets are not openly available in a format that supports their use in data science. Here we report work in progress toward this goal, having converted the Ashliman Folktexts collection into a public dataset of annotated tale texts. The data can be accessed at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6575263.\n Published on 2022-06-24 11:47:11",

          "description": "In common with many technical aspects of digital humanities, the TEI has a reputation for being difficult to teach and difficult to learn, with potential practitioners put off by the large and (at first sight) intimidating set of guidelines, the seemingly complex hierarchical structure and the profusion of angle brackets. One-to-one or small group teaching in the context of a specific project is often the preferred method, where the short but steep learning curve required to engage with the TEI can be addressed in a way which is relevant to the aims and experience of the learner. This, however, is not a particularly efficient way of teaching. In this article, the authors discuss their experience of teaching (and learning) the TEI, and how lessons learned in contexts relating to specific projects might feed into the teaching of TEI in a more general setting – the Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School being the prime example.\n Published on 2022-05-24 13:09:19",

          "description": "This paper pioneers a new computational approach for the study of changes in shape of objects across time. Previously, such a study was undertaken by scholars using a purely visual approach and relied on images of objects or in-person observations. This paper’s approach is based on 3D scans of historical artefacts. Sample points are extracted from these 3D scans and the distance between analogous points across different objects is computed using an approximation of the Wasserstein metric, namely the Sinkhorn distance. In this paper, the approach is demonstrated on a small set of ancient Greek vessels of the Krater, Pelike, and Kylix types, as the variation in their shapes across time is well known to archaeologists. Results offer, for the first time, a way of quantifying differences between objects. Benefits of this approach lie in its ability to quantify change, to study complex 3D material, and to analyse large datasets of objects, opening the possibility of constructing new large-scale studies of object shape across time and geographical regions. These have a range of applications in art history, archaeology, digital humanities, museology and extended reality studies.\n Published on 2022-05-20 12:09:58",

It is comprised of complete data management documentation and ethics documentation in English and French, concept notes in English and French, and participant data files that include .csv metadata sheets, .wav audio recordings of interviews, .jpeg photographs of the place of the interview and open ELAN .eaf transcriptions. The participant interview data relies on a narrative inquiry methodology and is collected in one-on-one interviews with researchers on the theme of anglophone expatriation and adaptation to French socio-physical space. These interviews are informal and interactive, aiming for a sharing of experience, since the researchers are, themselves, anglophone expatriates. The aim of this accompanying article is to provide information on the dataset through a concomitant reflection on the research context in France and the affordances of the increasingly powerful TGIR Huma-Num digital humanities infrastructure, as well as the tensions that are prevalent in the Franco-European space between the demands of Open Science and the restrictions of the European General Data Protection Regulations. These affordances and this tension have framed the process that has resulted in the Places data architecture.\n Published on 2022-05-06 11:58:37",

          "description": "Using the reparation movement for Japanese colonial and wartime atrocities as a case study, this paper explores the applicability of graph database management systems to network analysis research and teaching in the field of digital humanities. Since the late 1980s, Asian victims of Japanese colonial and wartime atrocities (such as the infamous “comfort women” system) began to sue the Japanese government and corporations with the help of local and Japanese lawyers and activists. This paper uses the plethora of publicly available court materials produced by the movement to study social networks in this transnational historical justice movement and illustrate how graph database management systems can upgrade traditional network analysis methodologies in digital humanities. By inputting the data about lawsuits and lawyers in the movement into graph database applications like Neo4j and GraphXR, the paper demonstrates the advantages of managing network data in graph database structure in terms of scalability, modifiability, intuitive visibility, query efficiency, and analysis potential over relational database structure, which is the mainstream in network analysis research.\n Published on 2022-04-25 13:37:52",

          "description": "While digital archiving has long been standard for linguistics, archives themselves are heterogeneous (Aznar & Seifart 2020), and archived linguistic material is important for researchers and communities, particularly for language reclamation (cf. Baldwin & Olds 2007; Whalen et al. 2016; Hinton 2003, 2018; Kung et al. 2020). The format and usability of scholarly archival collections is shaped by the functions of the management practices at the stewarding institution, making an appreciation of the range of access services provided by such institutions relevant to the evaluation of individual collections.\nHere we report on a review of 41 digital language archives. Three factors are examined: 1) accessibility, including metadata and site navigation; 2) discoverability, or searchability and internal navigation; and 3) functionality, the overall ease of data retrieval and use. We recognize that the decisions made by both stewards and depositors can greatly impact the accessibility of archived materials; to that end, we present recommendations for how archives might increase the utility of their holdings for their users. We emphasize that our intention is not to dissuade linguists from using archives because of these issues, and we recognize the tremendous amount of work that goes into the upkeep of digital infrastructure, often with very limited institutional support. Implementing such recommendations at an institutional level can establish a fairer peer-review process of archival collections. By delineating precisely what standards fall under the archive management level and what procedures individual depositors are responsible for, the roles of “archivist” and “depositor” become clearer.\n Published on 2022-03-24 11:09:26",

This dataset is a bilingual Chinese–English parallel dataset of news in the domain of finance. It is open access in its original state without transformation, and has been made not for machine translation as has been used, but for intelligent mining, in which we conducted many experiments using up-to-date text mining techniques: clustering (topic modeling, community detection, k-means), topic prediction (naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM, Bert), and pattern discovery (dictionary based, time series).

[...]The concept of LoGaRT - treating local gazetteers as “databases” by themselves - is an innovative and pertinent way to articulate the essence of the platform: providing opportunities for multi-level analysis from the close reading of the sources (using, for example, the carousel mode) to the large-scale, “bird’s eye view” of the materials across geographical and temporal boundaries. Local gazetteers are predominantly textual sources – this characteristic of the collection is reflected in the capabilities of LoGaRT as well, since some of its key capabilities include data search (using Chinese characters), collection and analysis, as well as tagging and dataset comparison. That said, LoGaRT also offers integrated visualization tools and supports the expansion of the collection and tagging features to the images used in a number of gazetteers. The opportunity to smoothly intertwine these visual and textual collections with Chinese historical maps (see CHMap) is an added, and much welcome, advantage of the tool, which helps to develop sophisticated and multifaceted analyses.\n[Click ‘Read more’ for the full post!]",

          "description": "Introduction: Open Refine, the freely accessible successor to Google Refine, is an ideal tool for cleaning up data series and thus obtaining more sustainable results. Entries can be searched in alphabetical order or sorted by frequency, so that typing errors or slightly different variants can be easily found and adjusted. For example, with the help of the software, I discovered two such discrepancies in my Augustinian Correspondence Database, which I am now able to correct with one click in the programme. I was shown that I had noted \"As a reference to Jerome's letter it's not counted\" five times and \"As a reference to Jerome's letter, it's not counted\" three times. Consequently, if I searched the database for this expression, I would not see all the results. A second discrepancy was between the entry \"continuing reference (marked by Nam)\" and the entry \"continuing reference (marked by nam)\". Thanks to Open Refine, such errors can be completely avoided in the future.\n\nThe tutorial by Miriam Posner is a useful introduction to come in touch with the software. However, the first step of the installation is already out of date. While version 3.1 was still the latest when the tutorial was published, it is now version 3.5.2. Under Windows, you can now distinguish between a version that requires Java and a version with embedded OpenJDK Java, which I found very pleasing.\n\nIf needed, there are links at the end of the tutorial to other introductions that go into more depth.",

His dissertation examines the mukhaḍramūn—a generation of poets who lived between the pre-Islamic and Islamic era—focusing on the network of emotions surrounding the poetic experience of existing in the threshold of transition, known as khaḍramah. Drawing from theories of affect and emotion, he departs from a historical study of the mukhaḍramūn to develop a theory of khaḍramah that examines how this experience, vis-a-vis biography and anecdote, informs transformations in poetic forms indigenous to the Arabic language. Using optical character recognition and text analysis software, Rawad is compiling a digital archive of poetry collections central to his research to facilitate analysis of linguistic, stylistic, and formal patterns to explore new methods of close and distant reading. Rawad earned two MA degrees in Arabic from the University of Texas at Austin (2017) and the University of California, Los Angeles (2013). He was awarded a fellowship for the Center of Arabic Study Abroad (2014) in Amman, Jordan. Rawad received a Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship Dissertation Abroad Request (2021), Janet Lee Stevens Award in Arabic and Islamic Studies (2020) and was named a Mellon Graduate Fellow (2019). Also, he was nominated for the Texas Foreign Language Teaching Excellence Award (2017). His translations of Arabic poetry and literature appear in publications by Michigan Quarterly Review, Paris Review (forthcoming), Two Lines Press, DoubleSpeak, Words Without Borders, and Inventory.\n\n\nFellowship Date: \n\nApril, 2022",

          "description": "I’ve created a Zotero translator for the Libraries Tasmania catalogue. Using it, you can save metadata and digital resources to your own research database with a single click. Libraries Tasmania actually has three catalogues rolled into one – the main library catalogue, the Archives catalogue, and the Names Index. The translator works across all three. Features include:\nSelect and save items from a page of search results.\nSave individual items across the full range of formats. (By default, individual records in the catalogue open in a modal overlay. For Zotero to recognise the item you need to click on the Permalink button and open the record on a separate page.)\nAutomatically download digital images and PDFs attached to records. This works when the record points to a particular page – it won’t download multiple images from a single link. However, if a record contains multiple links to digitised pages (such as the Convict records in the Names Index), you’ll get them all!\nFields in the Archives catalogue and Name Index that don’t map to Zotero properties are saved as key/value pairs in Zotero’s ‘Extra’ field\n\nThe translator is now included in the main Zotero repository so should install and update itself automatically. If the Zotero browser extension doesn’t seem to be detecting Libraries Tasmania items you can force an update by right clicking on the Zotero icon in your browser toolbar and clicking on Preferences > Advanced > Update translators.\nMy work on this translator was not entirely altruistic – it’s going to be very useful in the Everyday Heritage project as Kate Bagnall and I try to bring together sources relating to Chinese heritage in Tasmania.\nBut I’m also very happy to be able to update my spreadsheet of Zotero support in Australian GLAM organisations and put Libraries Tasmania in the green! #dhhacks",

          "description": "I’ve created a Zotero translator for the Libraries Tasmania catalogue. Using it, you can save metadata and digital resources to your own research database with a single click. Libraries Tasmania actually has three catalogues rolled into one – the main library catalogue, the archives catalogue, and the names index. The translator works across all three. Features include:\nSelect and save items from a page of search results.\nSave individual items across the full range of formats. (By default, individual records in the catalogue open in a modal overlay. For Zotero to recognise the item you need to click on the Permalink button and open the record on a separate page.)\nAutomatically download digital images and PDFs attached to records. This works when the record points to a particular page – it won’t download multiple images from a single link. However, if a record contains multiple links to digitised pages (such as the Convict records in the Names Index), you’ll get them all!\nFields in the Archives catalogue and Name Index that don’t map to Zotero properties are saved as key/value pairs in Zotero’s ‘Extra’ field\n\nI’ve submitted the translator for inclusion in the official repository, but you’re welcome to take it for a test run in the meantime. Just follow these steps:\nFind out where your Zotero data folder is. From Zotero go to Edit > Preferences > Advanced > Files and Folders and click on Show Data Directory.\nOpen the translator file here. Then right click and choose Save as, navigate to your Zotero data folder, and save it in the ‘translators’ folder.\nRestart Zotero and your browser.\nHead to the Libraries Tasmania catalogue and try it!\nLet me know if you strike any problems. #dhhacks",

          "description": "If you have a dataset that you want to share as a searchable online database then check out Datasette – it’s a fabulous tool that provides an ever-growing range of options for exploring and publishing data. I particularly like how easy Datasette makes it to publish datasets on cloud services like Google’s Cloudrun and Heroku. A couple of weekends ago I migrated the TungWah Newspaper Index to Datasette. It’s now running on Heroku, and I can push updates to it in seconds.\nI’m also using Datasette as the platform for sharing data from the Sydney Stock Exchange Project that I’m working on with the ANU Archives. There’s a lot of data – more than 20 million rows – but getting it running on Google Cloudrun was pretty straightforward with Datasette’s publish command. The problem was, however, that…",

The proxy app then redirects you to the Trove API Console so you can see the results of the API query without needing a key.\nTo make it easy to use, I created a bookmarklet that encodes your current url and feeds it to the proxy. To use it just:\nDrag this link to your bookmarks toolbar: Open Trove API Console.\nRun a search in Trove’s newspapers.\nClick on the bookmarklet.\nThis little hack provides a bit of ‘glue’ to help researchers think their about search results as data, and explore other possibilities for download and analysis. #dhhacks",

In particular I’ve been pulling together harvests of the number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state. My first harvests date all the way back to 2011, before there was even a Trove API. Unfortunately, I didn’t run the harvests as often as I should’ve and there are some big gaps. Nonetheless, if you’re interested in how Trove’s newspaper corpus has grown and changed over time, you might find them useful. They’re available in this repository and also in Zenodo.\n\nThis chart shows how the number of newspaper articles per year in Trove has changed from 2011 to 2022. Note the rapid growth between 2011 and 2015.\nTo try and make sure that there’s a more consistent record from now on, I’ve also created a new Git Scraper – a GitHub repository that automatically harvests and saves data at weekly intervals. As well as the number of articles by year and state, it also harvests the number of articles by newspaper and category. As mentioned, these four datasets are updated weekly. If you want to get all the changes over time, you can retrieve earlier versions from the repository’s commit history.\nAll the datasets are CC-0 licensed and validated with Frictionless.\nThere’s also a notebook in the GLAM Workbench that explores this sort of data.",

As I’ve previously noted, reports from the ARDC and Academy of Humanities are now publicly available. There was a third document identified as relevant to my request that was finally released yesterday, but it isn’t what I was expecting. It’s a report of consultation relating to a discussion paper by Dandalo Partners, rather than the actual discussion paper itself! Clearly I spoke the wrong magic words, and should have asked for ‘discussion papers’ as well as ‘scoping studies’. FOI can be a bit of a fishing expedition. I’m considering whether I want to start the whole FOI process again by asking for the final version of the discussion paper, but in the meantime, I’ve put the currently-available documents in a Dropbox folder. Enjoy!\nThanks again to those who helped me cover the FOI costs!",

          "description": "Over the past few months I’ve been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work on the GLAM Workbench – automating, standardising, and documenting processes for developing and managing repositories. These sort of things ease the maintenance burden on me and help make the GLAM Workbench sustainable, even as it continues to grow. But these changes are also aimed at making it easier for you to contribute to the GLAM Workbench!\nPerhaps you’re part of a GLAM organisation that wants to help researchers explore its collection data – why not create your own section of the GLAM Workbench? It would be a great opportunity for staff to develop their own digital skills and learn about the possibilities of Jupyter notebooks. I’ve developed a repository template and some detailed documentation to get you started. The repository template includes everything you need to create and test notebooks, as well as built-in integration with Binder, Docker, Reclaim Cloud, and Zenodo. And, of course, I’ll be around to help you through the process.\n\nOr perhaps you’re a researcher who wants to share some code you’ve developed that extends or improves an existing GLAM Workbench repository. Yes please!  Or maybe you’re a GLAM Workbench user who has something to add to one of the lists of resources; or you’ve noticed a problem with some of the documentation that you’d like to fix. All contributions welcome!\nThe Get involved! page includes links to all this information, as well as some other possibilities such as becoming a sponsor, or sharing news. And to recognise those who make a contribution to the code or documentation there’s also a brand new contributors page.\nI’m looking forward to exploring how we can build the GLAM Workbench together. #dhhacks",

The Omeka S API is powerful, but the documentation is patchy, and doing basic things like uploading images can seem quite confusing. My code was an attempt to simplify common tasks, like creating new items.\nIn case it's of use to others, I've now shared my code as a Python package. So you can just `pip install omeka-s-tools` to get started. The code helps you:\ndownload lists of resources\nsearch and filter lists of items\ncreate new items\ncreate new items based on a resource template\nupdate and delete resources\nadd media to items\nadd map markers to items (assuming the Mapping module is installed)\nupload templates exported from one Omeka instance to a new instance\nThere's quite detailed documentation available, including an example of adding a newspaper article from Trove to Omeka. If you want to see the code in action, there's also a notebook in the Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench that uploads newspaper articles (including images and OCRd text) to Omeka from a variety of sources, including Trove searches, Trove lists, and Zotero libraries.\ncreate an issue in the GitHub repository. #dhhacks",

The basic test is, can Zotero capture useful, structured information about an item from the collection interface. The results are not great.\nZotero extracts information from a web site using a variety of 'translators'. Some of these translators look for generic information embedded in a web page, such as <TITLE> and <META> tags. Others are written to work with widely-used software systems, such as library catalogues. For bespoke systems, custom translators can be created to extract the necessary data. But sometimes, the data just isn't available in a form Zotero can access.\ncustom translator for it many years ago. There's also a custom translator for Trove's digitised newspapers, but the translator for other parts of Trove was broken by the site's upgrade in 2020. \n  \nDublin Core metadata in web pages, and Australian government agencies were expected to make use of AGLS to aid web discovery. But it seems these are no longer priorities.\n  \nThe good news is we can fix this, either by supporting and encouraging GLAM organisations to embed useful metadata, or by creating custom translators. There's been a lot of talk about HASS research infrastructure over the last six months, and it seems to me that some integration and cooperation in this area would make a big difference to the way researchers work with GLAM collections.\nonline form available if you'd like to contribute new results to the spreadsheet, or update existing details.",

Part of the problem is that once I've updated the packages, I have to run all the notebooks to make sure I haven't inadvertently broken something -- and this takes time. And in those cases where the notebooks need an API key to run, I have to copy and paste the key in at the appropriate spots, then remember to delete them afterwords. They're little niggles, but they add up, particularly as the GLAM Workbench itself expands.\nI've been looking around at Jupyter notebook automated testing options for a while.

          "description": "When women like two-time Nobel laureate Marie Skłodowska Curie appear in exhibitions on the history of technology and science, this might be a good sign for the visibility of women in STEM. However, it goes too far to take Curie’s presence as a proof for a gender sensitive museum practice. With initiatives like Queering Museums, museums start(ed) to discuss broader visions of gender diversity and queer(y)ing museum practices. But when and under what circumstances do museums begin to discuss what kind of gender knowledge they produce? How do museum makers reflect on gender gaps and biases in collections, exhibitions, and education, steering towards a more gender-informed museum making? Applying a Science and Technology Studies (STS) framework on selected case studies, this talk will discuss how museums put gender theory to practice and highlight the spatio-temporal situatedness of museum knowledge production about gender in historical perspective.\n \nWednesday, 29 June 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space and Webex\nIf you wish to participate, please send an e-mail to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link - or simply join us in person.\n29 June 2022\n  Public history\n  Cultural policies  Gender studies  Museology\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

In the process, we set aside some of the conventions of archive-based history and embraced approaches from different academic and non-academic fields. In this talk I’ll describe some of our choices, and how it led to some unexpected scholarly insights—and moments of joy.\n \n\n\n \nAndrew Russell is a co-founder of The Maintainers with Lee Vinsel, in 2016. As a co-director, he works with Lee, Jessica, and Lauren on research projects, outreach, and a variety of organizational work that goes into maintaining the Maintainers. His background is in the history of technology, where he writes and teaches about subjects such as Internet history, technical standards, and technology in American life. He really enjoys seeing connections and patterns between maintenance in our personal lives and maintenance on broader scales, such as in organizations or state or national governments.\n \nMonday, 4 July 2022\n\n\n14.00 - 15.00\nHybrid event: C²DH Open Space and Webex\nIf you want to participate, just come to the 4th floor of the MSH or contact vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu for the Webex link.\n4 July 2022\n  Public history\n  Repairing technology – fixing society?

Stephen Graham and Nigel Thrift (2007) highlighted that “repair and maintenance are not incidental activities. In many ways, they are the engine room of modern economies and societies”. However, we still know very little about the actual developments of repair practices in the past and today. In his essay “Rethinking repair”, Steven Jackson (2014) therefore called for what he coined “broken world thinking”. He argues that we should take “erosion, breakdown, and decay, rather than novelty, growth, and progress, as our starting points” when we want to study consumption and use. Broken world thinking is an …",

The goal and methods of this project were slightly different from those of the Special Commission for the Study of the Spoliation of Jewish Property in Luxembourg during the war 1940-1945, which gave its final report to the Luxemburgish Government in 2009. The “road-book” of the project, in the form of a series of questions, was set by the convention that framed it, signed in 2019. But as the project unfolded, this frame had to evolve. Which sources were actually available? Which research question did we want to address? Which methods did we want to use?\nThis session of the Research Seminar will present how the project evolved since it started in January 2020 and which – sometimes very practical – challenges still lie ahead for its remaining 18 months.\n \nWednesday, 15 June 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space and Webex\nIf you wish to participate, please send an e-mail to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link - or simply join us in person.\n15 June 2022\n  Contemporary history of Luxembourg\n  History of the spoliation of Jewish property in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (1930s - 1950s)\n  Holocaust  Jewish history  WW2\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

For a century (approx. 1870-1970) the Minett was shaped by iron ore mining and the iron and steel industry. Rapid economic and population growth, urbanisation and labor migration have had a major impact on the history of the region, as have economic crises, environmental pollution and precarious housing and living conditions.\nRemixing Industrial Pasts in the Digital Age is a project of the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH ), launched in fall 2019 and funded by the European Capital of Culture Esch2022 asbl.\nThe \"Minett Stories\" virtual exhibition was developed in collaboration between the Remix team, Milan-based design studio Calibro and Bergamo-based software company Inmagik. The Remix team spent two and a half years researching and sourcing the underlying sources, designing the exhibition, and writing all the storyboards, scripts, story texts, and captions for the 22 exhibition chapters. The focus was on various forms of transmedia storytelling, including several interactive video documentaries, graphic novels, interactive maps, interactive podcasts, and two radio plays.

The counter argument would be that historians are not at the mercy of data providers but could become more active in the digitisation decisions, not only by lobbying memory organisations…",

          "description": "Based on a collection of local and national archival sources, police reports, and press articles, this talk will explore how rock’n’roll and pop music were received in France in the 1960s and the 1970s. Although some ‘threats,’ such as violence and loose moral at rock’n’roll concerts, were present in other countries as well, this talk shows that other so-called hazards should be read in the light of the French context. This was marked by the shadow of the dark years of the Vichy regime, the end of the Algerian war, students’ protests in May 1968, and the lasting influence of the left-wing revolutionary spirit.\nFlorence Tamagne is associate professor in contemporary history at the University of Lille. She has notably published Histoire de l’homosexualité en Europe, Berlin, Londres, Paris (1919-1939) (Seuil, 2000), Mauvais Genre ? Une histoire des représentations de l’homosexualité (La Martinière, 2001) and Le crime du Palace.

          "description": "The “Liewen am Minett” project came to life by an initiative of the Minister of Culture Robert Krieps in 1986. In the photo book’s foreword he stated that the heart of Luxembourg’s industry, “the cradle of its prosperity and the material support of national independence” – the Minett – has been unfairly overlooked, and its “new type of man” – the Minettsdäpp – largely unseen. “It is therefore a kind of injustice,” Krieps continued, “that we want to redress by doing justice to a world which, over the past ten years, has experienced deep anguish and new transformations. We present a snapshot of a part of our country whose rich facets are unknown.” The photo book, curated by Jean Back, exhibited photos of 16 amateur and professional photographers. “Liewen am Minett” was arguably the first soc…",

          "description": "This presentation will consider the limits of search for exploring digital cultural heritage and discuss some of the alternative modes of discovery that become possible through data linking and visualisation. It will draw on the experience of two projects: the Heritage Connector and the Congruence Engine. Both are concerned with unlocking the full potential of museum catalogues, which are largely unstructured, variable in consistency and overwhelmingly composed of what might be described as ‘thin’ records. The Heritage Connector project sought to build links at scale between the collections of the UK’s Science Museum Group, the Victoria and Albert Museum and Wikidata, and the Congruence Engine initiative expands this work to include data from more than 20 cultural heritage and university partners. New forms of visualisation and access are at the heart of these interdisciplinary collaborations. The presentation will conclude by considering how useful these methods might be for exploring vast born-digital collections, such as web and social media archives.\n \n\n\n \nJane Winters is Chair of Digital Humanities and Pro-Dean for Libraries at the School of Advanced Study, University of London.

          "description": "The history of psychiatry is a history of the difference between normality and madness. However, this difference is becoming increasingly fragile. On the one hand, with the unlocking of psychiatric institutions and the social integration of inmates, madness is becoming everyday normality; on the other hand, behavioural and reaction patterns such as rush, stress or attention deficit are pathologised. Thus, established historiographies, based on the traditional dichotomy, loose purchase on this phenomenon. This is the ground assumption of our project: it takes the erosion of the difference between normal and pathological as the central development in dealing with psychic alterity. This phenomenon lacks adequate historical consideration. Our aim is to historicize the interdependent relationship between the history of psychiatry and historiography, and thus to turn it into an instrument of analysis of the perceived erosion.\n \nWednesday, 20 April 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nHybrid event: C²DH Open Space and online\nIf you want to participate online, please send an e-mail to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link or participate in person by simply coming to the C²DH.\n\n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/logo_research_seminars_content_list.png?itok=r2xDOs_L\n  Research seminar with Benoît Majerus and Samuel Dal Zilio.\n  20 April 2022\n  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Normal#Verrückt.

The exhibition is part of the European Capital of Culture Esch2022 programme. It has been curated by the C²DH REMIX team in collaboration with the Milan-based artist collective Tokonoma and 2F Architettura.\nVisitors will travel through the region’s industrial past in a time machine whose audiovisual narrative unfolds around three main themes: industry, people and landscapes. Using analogue slide projections and audio collages, a remix of fragmented stories is presented throughout the exhibition hall: the violent erasure of natural landscapes by industrial sites; the relentless growth and transformation of indust…",

Thinking through questions of materiality, memory and collecting, the lecture will consider especially those collections held in British military museums arising through colonial wars. The research that informs the lecture comes out of a multi-year research project, combining material anthropology and military history, that seeks to address in particular the material legacies in military museums, as distinct from those in national museums. In recent years the question of colonial collections has regained popular prominence, with a clear association of European collections of the non-European world with the phenomenon of looting, and thus within a wider debate about the legitimacy and legality…",

In this context, the 'FinLux' seminar is held on a monthly basis. It is a place for researchers to discuss ongoing research projects in banking and financial history in a broad sense. The fundamental theme of the seminars is a reflection on which topics, actors, sources, and methods can be used to write the history of the Luxembourg financial centre.\nAll sessions start at 18:00 sharp and will take place virtually at https://unilu.webex.com/meet/benoit.majerus.

          "description": "The project “Ambivalences of Europeanization” aims to reflect on the concept of Europeanization. While ambivalences form a crucial aspect of modernization research, there has been no systematic reflection on the ambivalences of Europeanization. On the basis of numerous case studies, the authors argue that crises, conflicts and contradictory phenomena cannot be regarded as undesirable side effects of an otherwise \"well-intentioned\" and successful Europeanization. Rather, those ambivalences that are evident in colonialism or in the European history of violence are inscribed in the modern concept of Europeanization and accounts for its polyvalence. \nTimm Beichelt is Professor of European Studies at European University Viadrina Frankfurt/Oder and Director of the Viadrina Institute for European Studies; Clara Maddalena Frysztacka is research associate at European University Viadrina Frankfurt/Oder.\n \nTuesday, 22 February 2022 at 5:00PM CET via Webex\nFor the Webex link please contact Adelina Stefan at oana.stefan@uni.lu.\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/cover_ade_1_copy.jpg?itok=z3Eooaj7\n  'Europe Seminar' with Timm Beichelt and Clara Maddalena Frysztacka (European University Viadrina Frankfurt/Oder).\n  22 February 2022\n  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Nation-building\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "The Charles Translator for Ukraine: A development by LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ\n\n            \nThe automatic translator for Czech and Ukrainian, recently developed at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÚFAL) of Charles University, is now also available as a mobile application for Android. Users can download the Charles Translator for Ukraine app free of charge from the Google Play store. \nThe translator was developed with support of the LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ, and runs on the LINDAT technical infrastructure. It was developed in record time after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent wave of refugees into the Czech Republic, and it has been freely available for non-commercial purposes since mid-March at https://translator.cuni.cz. The web service has logged almost a quarter of a million hits in April, which, together with the demand from owners of smart mobile devices running Android, has triggered the development of a mobile application. \nThe application allows translation between Czech and Ukrainian in both audio and text form, and phonetic transcriptions between Latin and Cyrillic are available for translations. \nThe release of the mobile application is a significant event in the historical context of research and development of machine translation at the ÚFAL and also at LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ. The importance of this moment was enhanced by the introduction of the new name of the Czech-Ukrainian translation system Charles Translator for Ukraine, thereby subscribing to the brand name Charles University. With the addition of translation pairs of languages, the name should be narrowed down to Charles Translator in the future, allowing the researchers from ÚFAL to combine this new translator, developed in connection with the war in Ukraine, with the existing translation service available in LINDAT for other languages.\n\n      Julia Misersky\n 17 June 2022",

These fellowships are meant to extend from January through December. However, in late 2020 and early 2021 we developed a communications policy to better support the Communications Team. This work delayed the fellowship call for applications, reviews, and onboarding.\nOur current fellows, Anna Sofia Lippolis and Erdal Ayan began their work with ADHO in June 2021. To ensure that they have the same opportunities as previous fellows who have worked with us most or all of a calendar year—such as completing a special communications project and participating in communications around the Digital Humanities conference—ADHO’s COB have voted to extend their fellowships through December 2022. Anna and Erdal have accepted their extensions, and we are looking forward to working with them over the next year.\nThis means that we will not be accepting Communications Fellowship applications for 2022. The next round of applications for 2023 will open in November 2022.\nDrafted by Hannah Jacobs (Communications Officer)\n\n\nPost Date: \n\nThursday, November 18, 2021",

In the same way, a IIIF object is built using JSON, and links together metadata and powerful image capabilities which allow institutions to deliver ultra-high resolution images quickly and efficiently to a IIIF viewer.

While I typically read with a notebook next to me, much of my thoughts and reactions to what I read are overlayed directly on the text. An underlined phrase, a scribbled connection, a stray exclamation point reflecting the thrill of being surprised (amazing!) or feeling righteously indignant (how dare he!?!). While I’ve experimented with the highlighting and comment features offered by different pdf readers, these have never felt as satisfying as the closeness of scribbling my reflections alongside the text that prompted them. \n\nEarlier in October, I had the pleasure of having my private world of pen and paper marginalia broadened by the concept of social annotation.

The current iteration of the project’s corpus includes twenty-six distinct titles containing over a hundred thousand articles, poems, editorial commentaries, advertisements, theater listings as well as images representing a variety of genres and media. Through the abstraction of journal elements as data, we seek to produce representations that will make not only the journals’ contents but also big picture structures available to distant reading and analysis for researchers.\nWe ask: What can we ask of periodicals that we might not of other digitized media? What can machine learning tell us about these journals that might be overlooked in ordinary or habitual reading practices? What patterns can we discover across a collection? What types of images or subjects appear and disappear in the history of publication? Are there unexpected points of continuity or difference between a diverse set of journals published at the start of the twentieth century?\nThis Stanford-based extension of the project, begun at Princeton University and in collaboration with ITMO University in St. Petersburg, focuses particularly on the diverse images featured in the journals’ pages. Having begun with the articulation of rudimentary image typologies and applied computer learning to the image corpus (identifying illustrations, photographs, caricature, advertisements as well as subjects), we are currently looking for new ways to extract data related to color values and quantity across the journal runs.\nImage top: Training the model in document segmentation to predict constituent parts of a journal page, from 30 dnei\nImage bottom: Example of a color mask for an image in the journal 30 dnei",

Ask away, and @enrique.manjavacas and @l.fonteyn will try to help you as much as we can.\nMore information on the project can be found on our website:\nhttps://macberth.netlify.app/\nMacBERTh is the cover term for a suite of language models (more specifically, BERT models) pre-trained on historical textual material (date range: 1450-1950).\nResearchers who interpret and analyse historical textual material are well-aware that languages are subject to change over time, and that the way in which concepts and discourses of class, gender, norms and prestige function in different time periods. As such, it is quite important that the interpretation of textual/linguistic material from the past is not approached from a present-day point-of-view, which is why NLP models pre-trained on present-day language data are less than ideal candidates for the job. That’s where MacBERTh can help.\nAt present, a model pre-trained on historical English (1450-1950) has been published in the huggingface repository. The release of a Dutch historical model is planned for 2022.\nFor publications and talks related to the project, as well as information on how to cite us, please check our website. If you end up using our model for you research, we would love to highlight and refer others to your work on our website as well, so please do not hesitate to contact us to share your work.\n2 posts - 2 participants\nRead full topic",

These technologies make it possible to automate labeling tasks that would otherwise be too time-consuming or tedious to perform by hand. However, NLP systems do not achieve perfect accuracy. More concerning, their errors are not uniformly distributed, but rather, can encode and propagate bias from the training data. In this talk, I will survey the validity threats that arise from various types of learning-based NLP systems, ranging from classical models like logistic regression to contemporary architectures that combine pretraining, fine-tuning, and domain adaptation. Of particular interest is the problem of underspecification, highlighted by D’Amour et al (2020): even when overall test set accuracy can be estimated with high precision, the performance on other metrics may vary dramatically with seemingly irrelevant details such as the seed value used to randomly initialize the model’s parameters. After this survey, I will describe our approach to validity in our work on Abolitionist Networks (Soni et al 2021), which combines topic models and network analysis. I will conclude by offering a set of recommendations for practitioners in the digital humanities.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

As a first step towards olfactory information extraction, I will present ongoing work aimed at defining a theoretical framework to capture this information from a linguistic point of view. This framework has led to the development of a multilingual benchmark with annotated smell events, covering different time periods and domains. Based on this novel dataset, it is now possible to make cross-lingual comparisons, pointing out different attitudes and perceptions of good and bad smells. The annotation effort will also inform the development of NLP-based systems for olfactory information processing. Existing challenges of this task and possible solutions will also be discussed in the talk.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

          "description": "When comparing topics between LDA models trained on different collections of text, it’s common for people to use the Jensen-Shannon divergence as a measure of the (dis)similarity between topics. However, this is complicated a bit if the two collections being compared have differences in their vocabularies (i.e., some word types may be present in one collection, but not the other).\nFor example, if collection 1 has vocabulary {a, b, c} and collection 2 has vocabulary {b, c, d}, then comparisons between topics trained on the different collections require a to be inserted into the topics from collection 2, and d to be inserted into the topics learned from collection 1. My guess is that most people just insert such words with probability of 0, but I haven’t been able to find a case where this is actually addressed in the paper.\nI’m trying to think through the implications of how this issue might be handled and am looking for literature that addresses this in any way.

          "description": "I know the Computer Vision for/with Humanities (data) community isn’t that well represented yet at CHR, and when reading the CFP I realised one way that might attract more publications from CV might be to adapt the short paper guideline. The main CV conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV) all follow the same policy with regards to dual/double submission (CMT submissions Website | CVPR 2021) which is typically followed by other CV conferences such as BMVC.\nThis policy doesn’t allow submission with substantial overlap; where substantial is defined as 20% or more, which is quite restrictive. But the policy also offers the great option in that papers of 4 pages or less are not considered publications, i.e.: “A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined to be a written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, was accepted.”. Explicitly accommodating this policy would make it more appealing for CV researchers that have a DH/CH leaning to submit to CHR, as it doesn’t involve choosing between venues.\nI’m aware that the CFP defines short papers as ‘up to 3000 words (ca. 6 pages references, abstract and tables/illustrations excluded)’, so in theory one could submit a short paper of <= 4 pages. But 4 pages including abstract & tables/figures is a lot shorter than the current ‘short paper’, and might require a different reviewing approach.\nA different submission type, or shortening the short paper, would in my view make CHR more attractive for CV people. Although I understand this might go against the aim of attracting original research and to be a home for research that doesn’t fit elsewhere! Happy to hear thoughts on this.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

During the COVID-19-lockdowns, the digital presence of museums was no longer merely one possible extension of exhibition spaces, but rather the only way to reach the public. While our conference in 2021 focused on the crisis-related (re)turn to one’s own collections, this time it shifts to questions beyond binary concepts, such as media specificity, hybridity, and mixed reality. In five thematic blocks, the lectures deal with how the digital and the analog can be productively, conceptually, and aesthetically interwoven in a museum setting. We are delighted that Max Hollein, the director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, is our keynote speaker.\n \nRegistration, the program, and other information can be found on the conference website: https://www.belvedere.at/en/digitalmuseum2022.",

The starting point of the discussion lies in the work with legacy materials and necessary skills for reviewing them. The discussion of skills and knowledge relevant for this task lays out requirements for training and preparing academics and professionals for curation in ways that creates career options. Due to the importance of properly maintained data sets and the time-consuming nature of curation, this specialisation deserves the same merit as other areas of linguistics and should be treated equally.\n Published on 2021-11-30 10:50:54",

In this context, the dominant discourses have been generated in the Global North, overwhelmingly by a minority of wealthy and powerful authors, reflecting narrowly on a crisis that, while impacting the whole world, is experienced in vastly different ways. This article frames and contextualises data from this project through an introduction to the background, contexts, and methods of a project designed to reflect the lived experiences of, perspectives on, and responses to COVID-19 in vulnerable communities across sub-Saharan Africa. The project has been carried out by a large team of collaborators who prioritise the lived experiences, customs, and needs of the communities engaged through a culturally responsive and arts-based research approach. The article points to the methodological implications of arts-based research to explore plural perspectives in participatory ways, and the socio-political possibilities of amplifying the voices of under-represented and under-served communities in Africa, in terms of global health in a pandemic context.\n Published on 2021-11-30 11:03:37",

For each game walkthrough, we provide frequencies of unigrams and bigrams, treating the walkthrough document as a Bag of Words. In addition, we provide word frequencies at the sentence level. Furthermore, the GWTC contains a number of game-related metadata, including title, publisher, developer, year, and genre. All the language statistics and metadata are stored in separate plain text files and can be referenced through uniform resource names (URN). These URNs can also be used to derive any combination of statistics and metadata. Researchers, for instance, can investigate the most frequent unigrams for games in the “Adventure” genre.

          "description": "Existing text recognition engines enables to train general models to recognize not only one specific hand but a multitude of historical hands within a particular script, and from a rather large time period (more than 100 years). This paper compares different text recognition engines and their performance on a test set independent of the training and validation sets. We argue that both, test set and ground truth, should be made available by researchers as part of a shared task to allow for the comparison of engines. This will give insight into the range of possible options for institutions in need of recognition models. As a test set, we provide a data set consisting of 2,426 lines which have been randomly selected from meeting minutes of the Swiss Federal Council from 1848 to 1903. To our knowledge, neither the aforementioned text lines, which we take as ground truth, nor the multitude of different hands within this corpus have ever been used to train handwritten text recognition models. In addition, the data set used is perfect for making comparisons involving recognition engines and large training sets due to its variability and the time frame it spans. Consequently, this paper argues that both the tested engines, HTR+ and PyLaia, can handle large training sets. The resulting models have yielded very good results on a test set consisting of unknown but stylistically similar hands.\n Published on 2021-07-09 10:49:34",

The language model architectures include word type embeddings (word2vec and fastText) and contextualized models (BERT and Flair). For each architecture, we trained a model instance using the whole dataset. Additionally, we trained separate instances on text published before 1850 for the type embeddings, and four instances considering different time slices for BERT. Our models have already been used in various downstream tasks where they consistently improved performance.

Moreover, we discuss a well-defined end-to-end process that has been streamlined and optimised to produce high-quality open text data based on parliamentary documents. Based on the above methodology, a representative sample of 2,000 questions from four parliamentary periods in the Hellenic Parliament has been extracted, validated, and placed into an open data repository. Furthermore, open data production is analysed, and several degrees of freedom in its application in alternative data sets are proposed and discussed. Consequently, the authors argue that this method constitutes a transferable and scalable practice that can be used by other representative institutions for the creation and subsequent study of their open data.\n Published on 2021-08-04 11:00:17",

We annotate a sizeable collection of Swiss press articles (183,270), extracted via the impresso interface1 using topic modelling (MALLET)2 as well as a naïve Bayes classifier (script by Milan van Lange).\nThe methodological discussion we propose is to explore how text mining can help identify historical discourses that are difficult to query with keywords because of their inherent ambiguity and how to grasp them in a large corpus. We argue that the automated annotations can provide a body of corroborating evidence of the searched discourse, to be used as an intermediary and heuristic analysis step.\n Published on 2021-09-17 11:39:06",

          "description": "This work presents an enriched version of the Parish Memories (1758–1761), an essential Portuguese historical source manually transcribed. It is enriched with annotations of named entities of the types PERSON, LOCATION, and ORGANIZATION. The annotation was done automatically for the whole collection where two researchers annotated a portion of it manually for evaluation purposes. In this dataset, we provide the tagged texts, the lists of extracted entities, and frequency counts. The corpus is useful for historians, allowing, for instance, comparative analyses between parishes and regions or to calculate the area of influence of a locality. The paper describes the creation and evaluation of the corpus, discusses its applications and limitations. This first release may be improved by other researchers interested in the historical source itself or in the technology employed in its annotation.\n Published on 2021-09-09 11:25:41",

          "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the obvious implications for public health and the economy at a global scale, has also had significant social and cultural effects: the partial or complete lockdown of public life breaks social and cultural networks and habits, and necessitates the invention of new forms of communication, contact, and inspiration. Over the course of the pandemic, various initiatives have emerged that have tried to capture this unique moment in history by collecting documentation on the social and cultural impact of the pandemic on people’s daily lives. Most of these collections were created bottom-up, either by actively approaching individuals or communities to contribute or be interviewed, or by opening platforms where citizens could directly contribute documentation. In this paper, we analyse two such citizen-generated collections of experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic: the ‘Corona in the City’ collection, assembled by the Amsterdam Museum for an online exhibition with the same title, and the ‘Dagboek Corona’ (Corona Diary) collection of diary contributions, assembled by the Dutch public historian and journalist José Boon. The paper discusses the background of these citizen-generated COVID-19 collections, assessing their scope and accessibility, and presenting a first, qualitative analysis of their content. We conclude with a reflection on the implications of the findings for people’s social life and identity, indicating how the datasets can be explored in further research and how the findings may benefit effective policy making.\n Published on 2021-07-21 12:09:35",

(https://melaniewalsh.github.io/BERT-for-Humanists/tutorials/ ). A further advantage of this training resource is that it has been written with sensitivity towards the target audience in mind:  in a way that it provides a gentle introduction to complexities of language models to scholars with education and background other than Computer Science.\n\n\nAlong with the Tutorials, the same blog includes Introductions about BERT in general and in its specific usage in a Google Colab notebook, as well as a constantly-updated bibliography and a glossary of the main terms ('attention', 'Fine-Tune', 'GPU', 'Label', 'Task', 'Transformers', 'Token', 'Type', 'Vector').",

          "description": "Introduction: in this study, Cebral Loureda analyzes how will and desire are conveyed in: Ethics, by Spinoza; The Phenomenology of Spirit, by Hegel; The World as Will and Representation, by Schopenhauer; and Thus spoke Zarathustra, by Nietzsche. With the idea of determining theses texts’ degree of cohesion, the author follows a computational and quantitative methodology to compare and contrast them, as well as assess their internal contradictions. A normalized corpus, statistics and visualizations are employed so as to evaluate the terminology, topoi and sentimentality of these works.  In relation to terminology, author’s findings revealed that Nietzsche uses a highly differentiated vocabulary from that of the other philosophers, adding marked emotional connotations to his discourse. Visualizations showed the terminological commonalities between Hegel and Schopenhauer and shed light on the former bearing the highest number of semantic connections with the other philosophers.  As for topoi, results showed there is a clear dichotomic tension between conceptual and vital experience in the studied documents. Redefining this dualism, however, Cebral Loureda observed that the concrete is always intertwined with the abstract and vice versa.  Regarding the sentimental dimension of these works, examination unveiled that Nietzsche’s presents the greatest negative sentimental load. In contrast, Spinoza’s is the most emotionally balanced. With all this, Cebral Loureda proves that there is a high degree of cohesion among these philosophical works, which link reason and emotion to will, time and spirit, core notions of modern philosophy and society.",

Based on a documentary corpus connected to the 2013 book by Alfred Reisch, which documented efforts by the CIA to disseminate books in the Soviet Bloc in the period 1956-1971, the authors use the Tableau Public platform to re-assess information science methods for researching historical events. Their analysis suggests that books distributed did not tend to have a more obvious political slant, but were more likely to have a broader universalist outlook. While it skirts around some of the limitations of visualization (highlighted elsewhere by Drucker and others) it offers a solid introduction to the benefits of a data-driven approach to a general audience.",

          "description": "One of the things I really like about Jupyter is the fact that I can share notebooks in a variety of different formats. Tools like QueryPic can run as simple web apps using Voila, static versions of notebooks can be viewed using NBViewer, and live versions can be spun up as required on Binder. It’s also possible to export notebooks at PDFs, slideshows, or just plain-old HTML pages. Just recently I realised I could export notebooks to HTML using the same template I use for Voila. This gives me another way of sharing – static web pages delivered via the main GLAM Workbench site.\nHere’s a couple of examples:\nPapers Past newspapers in DigitalNZ – showing which Papers Past newspapers are available through DigitalNZ\nTrove newspapers – number of issues per day, 1803–2020 – the number of newspaper issues published every day in Trove\n\nBoth are HTML pages that embed visualisations created using Altair. The visualisations are rendered using javascript, and even though the notebook isn’t running in a live computing environment, there’s some basic interactivity built-in – for example, you can hover for more details, and click on the DigitalNZ chart to search for articles from a newspaper. More to come! #dhhacks",

See the Using Nectar help page for more information.\n\nI’ve also taken the opportunity to make use of the new container registry service developed by the ARDC as part of the ARCOS project. The app now pulls the GLAM Workbench Docker images from Quay.io via the container registry’s cache. This means that copies of the images are cached locally, speeding things up and saving on data transfers.

Most of the changes are related to management, maintenance, and integration of the repositories. Things like:\nSetting up GitHub actions to automatically generate Docker images when the repositories change, and to upload the images to the Quay.io container registry\nAutomatic generation of an index.ipynb file based on README.md to act as a front page within Jupyter Lab\nAddition of a reclaim-manifest.jps file to allow for one-click installation of the repository in Reclaim Cloud\nAdditional documentation in README.md with instructions on how to run the repository via Binder, Reclaim Cloud, Nectar Research Cloud, and Docker Desktop.\nAddition of a .zenodo.json metadata file so that new releases are preserved in Zenodo\nSwitch to using pip-tools for generating requirements.txt files, and the include unpinned requirements in requirements.in\nUpdate of all Python packages\nFrom the user’s point of view, the main benefit of these changes is the ability to run the repositories in a variety of different environments depending on your needs and skills. The Docker images, generated using repo2Docker, are used by Binder, Reclaim Cloud, Nectar, and Docker Desktop. Same image, multiple environments! See ‘Run these notebooks’ in the DigitalNZ and Te Papa sections of the GLAM Workbench for more information.\n\nOf course, I’ve also re-run all of the notebooks to make sure everything works and to update any statistics, visualisations, and datasets. As a bonus, there’s a couple of new notebooks in the DigitalNZ repository:\nQueryPic DigitalNZ – a web app to visualise searches in Papers Past over time (I’ll post some further info about this shortly)\nPapers Past newspapers in DigitalNZ – displays details of the Papers Past newspapers available through DigitalNZ (you can view the results as an HTML page)\n#dhhacks",

If they do, they can put a link to them in the list of GLAM Jupyter resources. But what if they want to add the notebooks to the GLAM Workbench itself?\nTo make this easier, I’ve been working on a template repository for the GLAM Workbench. It generates a new skeleton repository with all the files you need to develop and manage your own section of the GLAM Workbench. It uses GitHub’s built in templating feature, together with Cookiecutter , and this GitHub Action by Stefan Buck. Stefan has also written a very helpful blog post.\nThe new repository is configured to do various things automatically, such as generate and save Docker images, and integrate with Reclaim Cloud and Zenodo. Lurking inside the dev folder of each new repository, you’ll find some basic details on how to set up and manage your development environment.\nThis is just the first step. There’s more documentation to come, but you’re very welcome to try it out. And, of course, if you are interested in contributing to the development of the GLAM Workbench, let me know and I’ll help get you set up!",

This is where we pick up the story…\nSo what has changed?\nGenerally speaking there seem to be two major changes.\nThere’s a much greater focus on consultation and collaboration.\nThere’s less detail about what will actually be developed.\nThese two changes can work together positively. The details of what’s being developed can be worked out through consultation, ensuring that what’s developed meets real research needs.…",

You can then download the PDFs of those issues, supplying an optional date range.

It also makes it possible to create different pathways for users, depending on their digital skills, institutional support, and research needs.

          "description": "Way back in 2013, I went to the eResearch Australasia conference as the manager of Trove to talk about new research possibilities using the Trove API. Eight years years later I was back, still spruiking the possibilities of Trove data. This time, however, I was discussing Trove in the broader context of GLAM data – all the exciting possibilities that have emerged as galleries, libraries, archives and museums make more of their collections available in machine-readable form. The big question is, of course, how do researchers, particularly those in the humanities, make use of that data? The GLAM Workbench is my attempt to address that question – to provide humanities researchers with both the tools and information they need, and an understanding of the possibilities that might emerge if they invest a bit of time in working with GLAM data. My eResearch Australasia 2021 presentation provides a quick introduction to the GLAM Workbench, here’s the video, and the slides.\n\n\nA GLAM Workbench for humanities researchers from Tim Sherratt on Vimeo.\n\n\nThe presentation was pre-recorded, but I managed to sneak in an update via chat for those who attended the session.

There’s freshly-harvested data, as well as updated Python packages, integration with Reclaim Cloud, and automated Docker builds.\nIncluded is a notebook to harvest details of all books available from Trove in digital form. This includes both digitised books, that have been scanned and OCRd, as well as born digital publications, such as PDFs and epubs. The definition of ‘books’ is pretty loose – I’ve harvested details of anything that has been assigned the format ‘Book’ in Trove, but this includes ephemera, such as posters, pamphlets, and advertising.\nIn the latest harvest, I ended up with details of 42,174 ‘books’. This includes some duplicates, because multiple metadata entries can point to the same digital object. I thought it was best to preserve the duplicates, rather than discard the metadata.\nOnce I’d harvested the details of the books, I tried to see if there was any OCRd text available for download. If there was, I saved it to a public folder on CloudStor. In total, I was able to download 26,762 files of OCRd text.\n\nThe easiest way to explore the books is using this searchable database. It’s created using Datasette and is running on Glitch. Full text search is available on the ‘title’ and ‘contributors’ fields, and you can filter on things like date, copyright status, number of pages, and whether OCRd text is available for download. If there is OCRd text, a direct link to the file on CloudStor is included. You can use the database to filter the titles, creating your own dataset that you can download in CSV or JSON format.\nIf you just want the full list of books as a CSV file, you can download it here.

But amongst the items catalogued as ‘books’ are a wide assortment of ephemera, posters, advertisements, and other oddities. There’s no consistent way of identifying these items through the search interface, but because I’ve found the number of pages in each ‘book’ as part of the harvesting process, I can limit results to items with just a single digitised page – there’s more than 1,500! To make it easy to explore this collection of odds and ends, I’ve downloaded all the single page images and compiled them into one big PDF with links back to their entries in Trove. Enjoy your browsing!\n\nThis is another example of the ways in which we can extend and enrich existing collection interfaces using simple technologies like PDFs and CSVs. We can create slices across existing categories to expose interesting features, and provide new entry points for researchers.

          "description": "Some good news on the funding front with the success of the Everyday Heritage project in the latest round of ARC Linkage grants. The project aims to look beyond the formal discourses of ‘national’ heritage to develop a more diverse range of heritage narratives. Working at the intersection of place, digital collections, and material culture, team members will develop a series of ‘heritage biographies’, that document everyday experience, and provide new models for the heritage sector.\n\nDigital methods will play a major role in the project. I’ll be leading the ‘Heritage Hacks’ work package that will support the creation of the heritage biographies and develop a range of new tools and tutorials for use in heritage management contexts. All the tools, methods, and data generated through the project will be documented using Jupyter notebooks and published through the GLAM Workbench. Watch this space!\nThe project is led by Tracy Ireland (University of Canberra), with Jane Lydon (UWA), Kate Bagnall (UTAS), and me as chief investigators. Our industry partner is GML Heritage.",

          "description": "For a few years now I’ve been harvesting downloadable text from digitised periodicals in Trove and making it easily available for exploration and research. I’ve just completed the latest harvest – here’s the summary:\n1,163 digitised periodicals had text available for download\nText was downloaded from 51,928 individual issues\nAdding up to a total of around 12gb of text\nIf you want to dive straight in, here’s a list of all the harvested periodicals, with links to download a summary of available issues, as well as all the harvested text (there’s one file per issue). You’ll notice that the list includes a large number of parliamentary papers and government reports as well as published journals.\n\nAll of the harvested text is available from a public folder on CloudStor.\nThe harvesting process involves a few different steps:\nFirst I generate a list of periodicals available in digital form from Trove. This includes digitised titles, as well as born-digital titles submitted through e-Legal Deposit. This produced a CSV file containing the details of 7,270 titles. See this notebook for details.\nThen I work through this list of titles to find out how many issues of each title are available through Trove. This information isn’t accessible through the API, so I have to do some screen scraping.\nNext I work through the list of issues and try to download the text contents. Most of the born-digital titles don’t have downloadable text.\nOnce I’ve downloaded all the text I can from a title, I create a CSV file for it that lists the available issues and notes whether text is available for each. This file is stored with the text on CloudStor.\nOnce I’ve checked all the titles, I generate another CSV file that lists the details of all the periodicals that have downloadable text.\nThe code to harvest and document the downloaded text is available in this notebook. #dhhacks",

It includes all the metadata from Trove, as well as the full text of each document downloaded from the Parliamentary Library. There’s 3,995 documents in total, covering the period up until early April 2021.

OCR correction tends to get all the attention, but Trove users have also been busy organising resources using tags, lists, and comments. I used to refer to tagging quite often in presentations, pointing to the different ways they were used. For example, ‘TBD’ is a workflow marker, used by text correctors to label articles that are ‘To Be Done’. My favourite was ‘LRRSA’, one of the most heavily-used tags across the whole of Trove. What does it mean? It stands for the Light Rail Research Society of Australia, and the tag is used by members to mark items of shared interest. It’s a great example of how something as simple as plain text tags can be used to support collaboration and build communities.\n\nUntil its updat…",

          "description": "An article written by Kate Bagnall and me has just been published in a special issue of the Journal of World History focusing on digital history. And it’s open access!\nThe article is ‘Missing Links: Data Stories from the Archive of British Settler Colonial Citizenship’. In it we document our efforts to assemble a number of different datasets relating to naturalization. Here’s the abstract:\nDigitized sources and digital methods are changing the way that we do history. For historians of the British Empire, the digital age offers new possibilities for investigating the lives of those who moved around the empire and across the world. However, much discussion of the possibilities and problems of digital history have focused on the creation and use of full text resources, skipping over the analytical opportunities offered by the descriptive systems in which those texts are embedded. This article is an attempt to fill this gap by documenting a journey through archival data relating to nineteenth-century Chinese naturalization in the Pacific Rim settler colonies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. We argue that such data stories are critical if we are to understand both possibilities and pitfalls of research in digital collections.\nThere’s also an GitHub repository with code and data related to the article.",

          "description": "QueryPic is a tool to visualise searches in Trove’s digitised newspapers. I created the first version way back in 2011, and since then it’s taken a number of different forms. The latest version introduces some new features:\nAutomatic query creation – construct your search in the Trove web interface, then just copy and paste the url into QueryPic. This means you can take advantage of Trove’s advanced search and facets to build complex queries.\nMultiple time scales – previous versions only aggregated search results by year, but now you can also aggregate by month, or by day. QueryPic will automatically choose a time unit based on the date range of your query, but if you’re not happy with the result you can change it!\nLinks back to Trove – click on any of the points on the chart to search Trove within that time period. This enables you to zoom in and out of your results, from the high-level visualisation, to individual articles.\n\nThis version of QueryPic is built within a Jupyter notebook, and designed to run using Voila (which hides all the code and makes the notebook look like a web app). See the Trove Newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench for more information. If you’d like to give it a try, just click the button below to run it live using Binder.\n\nHope you find it useful! #dhhacks",

          "description": "Data visualization is very often viewed as an equivalent of statistical representation of data in all its forms. This representation serves effectively certain objectives such as abstraction, reduction, standardization, or legibility, of interest to some disciplines and use cases, namely business, engineering, and science. Numerous tools and programming languages allow to visualize data according to these principles. Other disciplines and areas of knowledge, such as history, literature, art, journalism, or education, are confronted with the need to use the same tools ignoring some fundamental principles of their own disciplines, to program from scratch new visual vocabularies and functionalities, or to use design tools that are disconnected from the data.\nAs part of my research, I study the needs of the different disciplines and areas of knowledge, based on their own definitions of data and data visualization, the relationship between the two of them, and the user interaction; but I also experiment with transforming the visualizations from one paradigm to another, so that they can be used in interdisciplinary projects, or to open new approaches to data visualization within the disciplines themselves. During this presentation of my early research, I will present the initial description of the paradigms with a visual gallery of examples. And the first ideas of transformation of the visualizations between paradigms.\n \nWednesday, 19 January 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nOnline - Webex\nIf you want to participate, please send an e-mail to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link.\n19 January 2022\n  Digital history & historiography\n  LuxTime Machine\n  Data Science  Visualisation\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Ils/elles travaillaient dans l’agriculture, l’industrie ou le secteur de la construction et réalisaient les travaux les plus pénibles et les moins bien rémunérés. Ces migrations ouvrières ont été tour à tour freinées ou encouragées, selon le contexte économique et les besoins de main d’œuvre dans le Nord de la France.

In this talk, I will ask you to participate in our interpretive process and help to name the clusters yourselves (then we can see how your labels line up with the ones that we came up with).

          "description": "Comics are often used in research as a counter-narrative for an Americanisation of European societies in the second half of the 20th century. The Franco-Belgian bande dessinée school meanwhile appears as a symbol of a successful resistance against the American superheroes.\nThis presentation of my thesis research has two primary aims:\non the one hand to portray the history of Franco-Belgian comics diffusion in a (Western) European context,\nbut on the other hand to critically examine the hypothesis of Europeanisation in the 1960s.\nWhile there is interest in the field of translation strategies that have been applied to central works of the Franco-Belgian school, there has been little attention paid to the editorial practices of the 1960s that facilitated this translation. Comics circulate across language barriers, and so allow insights into the relationship between different countries and cultures, the circulation of cultural goods inside and outside the production space, and the role of cultural mediators. Comics are also just one aspect of a transmedial and transnational space of the 1960s, factors that are most clearly indicated by comics magazines such as Journal de Tintin and Pilote, and these examples and their translations will form the main corpus of primary sources. This thesis will therefore consider the lens of publishing practice in order to shed a new light on these crucial aspects.\n \nWednesday, 17 Novvember 2021\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH open space and Webex\nIf you want to participate online, please send an email to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link.\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/logo_research_seminars_content_list.png?itok=r2xDOs_L\n  Research seminar with Jessica Burton, PhD candidate at the C²DH.\n  17 November 2021\n  Popkult60\n  Media history\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

It posits that industrialisation provided an aesthetic canvas for literary modernism and illustrates the ways in which the writer and journalist Batty Weber and his contemporaries sought to modernise a dominant ideological attachment to the soil by instituting the sky as the never-fixed embodiment of ideational change. In the arts, industry as a subject was mainly taken up by avant-garde writers, who constructed the industrial light spectacle and billowing smokes as symbols of intellectual progress and supranational cosmopolitan exchange.

At the same time, the trial marked a turning point in society's examination of the Holocaust and was very much in the spirit of the Cold War. The two German states also regularly reported on the trial in various media. These contemporary video clips, audio documents and newspaper articles were researched, compiled and commented on in a two-year project with students of Public History at the FU Berlin.

          "description": "During the last two decades, scholars have increasingly stressed the importance of culture in the history of European integration. Studies have unpacked the European Union’s attempts to sell the European project to audiences in the Member States and abroad, yet little is known about the role exhibitions played in this process. Developing stands and pavilions for regional, national and international exhibitions formed a significant strategy within the European cultural politics complex. My PhD thesis looks at the participation of the EU in the international exhibitions that hold the largest political and symbolic importance: World Expos.\nIn her thesis Anastasia Remes selects four pavilions as case studies: the European Coal and Steel Community pavilion in Brussels in 1958, the European Communities pavilion in Montreal in 1967, the European Community pavilion in Seville in 1992 and the EU pavilion in Shanghai in 2010. In this presentation, I will discuss how the European pavilions presented the EU at the various World Expos. I will expand on the three research questions that have driven my research: to what extent is the EU presented as a state, how is the EU’s global power constructed and how did the EU transform its message in engaging pavilions and exhibitions?\n \nTuesday, 21 September 2021, starting at 17.00\nOnline\nfor the Webex link please contact Adelina Stefan at oana.stefan@uni.lu\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/europe_seminar_remes21_septe_mber.jpg?itok=xB3flKaS\n  'Europe' seminar with Anastasia Remes, European University Institute\n  21 September 2021\n  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Cultural policies  European integration\n  Conferences\n  Published  \nColor photograph of the European Coal and Steel Community Pavilion at Expo 58, Unknown author, 1958, CEAB12-531, p.94, Historical Archives of the European Union, Florence, Italy.",

Hence, curation and research of parliamentary records, as well as the development of new tools and user interfaces relevant for the parliamentary data are embedded in critical societal discussions, and bear consequences from both scholarly and citizen perspectives.\nThese developments have led to enhanced opportunities and challenges for research and development. The workshop therefore draws together scholars across different disciplines to explore and showcase results and ongoing work on creating, publishing, and using digital parliamentary data in digital humanities research and applications. The aim is to foster interaction between the scholars in the humanities, social sciences, and computational sciences.\nDeadline for submitting the papers: 13 January 2022\nRead more and apply\n\n      Elisa Gorgaini\n 26 November 2021",

          "description": "Do you remember your last in-person conference? I do. I fondly remember reconnecting with familiar faces and learning alongside people brought together by shared interests. Yet some of the memories aren’t so warm: uncomfortable shoes, the buffet littered with dietary no-nos, some especially cringeworthy circus-themed post-lunch entertainment, and even connectivity problems when I misplaced my adapter! \nBut I also remember my first online conference, the Creative Commons Global Summit in November, 2020. As a conference volunteer, I remember how we scrambled to figure out what was possible: Recording? Networking? Translation?  Dance party? It was a formative and transformative experience. And as transformative as it was for me, it was no doubt even more transformative for people who rarely had access to in-person conferences.\nNow, with over a year of online conferences to learn from, it’s clear the innovations of online conferencing have set guideposts for the future of scholarly communication. Over the past nine months, the FORCE 2021 Organizing Committee  has worked tirelessly to create a conference that draws on the best of what we’ve all learned about global online events. Under the leadership of Osman Aldirdiri, we’ve crafted an event that aspires to be as welcoming as possible to scholarly innovators and communicators from all disciplines, geographies, communities, and career stages.\nWe hope you will join us December 7-9 at FORCE2021: Joining Forces to Advance the Future of Research Communications for an event centering exchange and open discussion. We are members of all of the communities that make up FORCE11--scholars, librarians, archivists, publishers, research funders, and more, broadly and inclusively defined. If you care about the future of research communications and the technologies that are enabling new possibilities, learn more about the conference and REGISTER.\n-Jennifer Miller for the FORCE2021 Organizing Committee",

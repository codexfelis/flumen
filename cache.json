The BBP is creating a digital database of Black book history with the aim of revealing the dynamic social networks and aesthetic practices specific to Black print cultures in the U.S.  During her talk, she will discuss her background in Black literary and cultural studies and how this informs her current work with the BBP. Her current research with the project is focused on developing and curating, in collaboration with graduate researchers, a corpus centering the print cultures of books authored by incarcerated Black writers and organizers of the late 20th century. The talk will explore the print cultures of Black prison movements while also attending to critical political, ethical and descriptive considerations involved in developing data about these works and writers. \n\nDr. Tajah Ebram is a cultural historian, teacher and community memory worker. She is currently the Black Studies Librarian at Rutgers University New Brunswick and the Rutgers lead for the Black Bibliography Project. Prior to her work at Rutgers, she was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Haverford College where she developed seminars around Black feminisms, carceral studies and Black environmentalism.  In 2020, she completed her PhD in English at the University of Pennsylvania where she focused on Philly Black freedom movements through the lenses of oral history, digital storytelling, and material culture.\n\n\n \n\n\nImage for Left Column:",

Christine earned her Ph.D. in the Ancient World from New York University in January 2023, where her doctoral work explored a premodern astronomical curriculum and its continued use in Greek and Arabic between the second and thirteenth centuries CE. Christine's research applies computational approaches to the study of manuscript transmissions in the Mediterranean world, particularly of mathematical and scientific works. During her postdoctoral term at Princeton, Christine is leveraging deep learning tools to classify and analyze visual data from digitized manuscripts, with a particular focus on paratextual material.\nThe written outputs of manuscript cultures are often characterized by a degree of multiformity, and certain texts see particularly high amounts of variation. Works used for didactic purposes, for instance, often saw multiple interventions in the hands of contemporary scholars and teachers. While digital imaging initiatives have made great strides in making manuscript materials more accessible, the fact that this data is in image format has until recently presented a speedbump for research that would grapple with such highly variable traditions. But this is changing with the machine learning technologies available today. This talk will explore how these tools can facilitate access at scale into the texts of digitized manuscript collections, as well as support research into material beyond the main text column, whether that material is textual (e.g., marginal annotations) or visual (e.g., scientific diagrams).\n\n\nImage for Left Column:",

Esta iniciativa en principio se encuentra deslindada de la institución política-cultural oficial cubana. Responde al concurso de los esfuerzos de sus integrantes y de los pobladores del municipio. En materia de formación profesional artística el núcleo central proviene de las Escuelas de Instructores de Arte en las especialidades de Teatro, Plástica, Música y Danza. La curva de aprendizaje en materia de realización audiovisual se sustenta en la práctica y participación en talleres, conferencias, cursos, festivales y otras experiencias educativa-formativas. Hasta la fecha se han producido alrededor de 100 materiales entre ficciones, documentales, videos musicales, video arte y carteles. Desde el año 2012 organizan la muestra de audiovisuales Hieroscopia con carácter anual. En ella se exhiben tanto las obras producidas por el MAN como de otros espacios de producción comunitaria en Cuba. El encuentro sirve también para el intercambio teórico sobre la práctica audiovisual aprovechando la presencia de realizadores, críticos, periodistas y en general, personal disímil que se dedica a lo cinematográfico en la isla. Por la constancia en el trabajo, la gestión de espacios para la creación y el debate y la vocación por la superación técnica y estética, el MAN se ha convertido en un foco del audiovisual cubano contemporáneo.\n\n\nInsert an Image: \n\n\n\n\nProject Principal Investigator: \n\nArmando   Navarro-Rojas",

Over the last year I’ve been gradually updating notebooks to use version 3 of the Trove API, but when version 2 suddenly disappeared a couple of weeks ago I had to hurriedly pull everything together. The Trove newspapers section includes 23 notebooks and 6 datasets, so it’s not a small job. The changes include:\nupdated all notebooks to use version 3 of the Trove API\nremoved remaining datasets from the code repository and created dedicated data repositories for them, integrating them with Zenodo where appropriate\nadded metadata to all the notebooks – this is used to build an RO-Crate metadata file for the code repository\nupdated all the Python packages\nadded a voila.json file to configure Voilá\nNone of the functionality of the notebooks should have changed. There’s a slight difference in the Finding non-English newspapers in Trove notebook because the language detection library I was using is no longer maintained. I’ve swapped in py3langid and it seems to work well, though the results are a little different. Interestingly, where the previous library thought that bad OCR was ‘Maltese’, the new one detects it as ‘Latin’! There’s no change to the list of newspapers with non-English language content detected by the notebook.\n\r\nThe documentation pages have also been updated. The notebook pages are now built using data from the code repository’s RO-Crate file. They also include embedded HTML previews of the notebooks. If a notebook generates visualisations, the visualisations are usually included in the HTML, so you can explore the outputs without running the notebook – see, for example, the charts in Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state. Most of the dataset pages now include links to explore the contents using Datasette-Lite.\nI still have to generate RO-Crate files for all the data repositories, but I wanted to get the code stuff finished first.",

          "description": "The Trove Data Guide aims to help researchers understand, access, and use data from Trove. But just because it’s about ‘data’ doesn’t mean  you need to be able to code. To understand Trove data and its  possibilities for research, you first need to understand Trove itself –  its history, its structure, its assumptions, and its limits. This  knowledge is useful to any Trove user.\nFor example, all Trove users would benefit from knowing more about works and versions, or how to use the ‘simple’ search box for complex queries. There’s also an introduction to what’s in (and not in) the digitised newspapers, and similar overviews for other digitised content such as books, parliamentary papers, and oral histories.\n\r\nNumber of newspapers articles in Trove by publication year, showing the change from 2011 to 2022\nSeveral sections document the way the web interface works (or doesn’t work). There’s a field guide to the various interfaces and identifiers you might come across, and details of options for downloading data. The Trove Data Guide fills many gaps in the official Trove  documentation, so check here if you run into problems, or can’t figure  out how to achieve a particular task. Perhaps you were wondering how to download digitised images at their highest available resolution?\nFor people who are more comfortable with code there are plenty of  useful snippets and complete working examples. For example there are  sections that document how to get metadata, text, and images from newspapers, and other digitised resources. There are also a series of ‘HOW TO’ pages that describe more complex data access methods.\nBut what can you do with Trove data? The Trove Data Guide’s Pathways provide detailed tutorials that lead you step by step through examples  of packaging Trove data for use with other digital tools.

These pathways link data from Trove to a variety of tools and approaches and include five detailed tutorials. The first four were:\nAnalysing keywords in Trove’s digitised newspapers\nWorking with a Trove collection in Tropy\nComparing manuscript collections in Mirador\nSharing a Trove List as a CollectionBuilder exhibition\nI’ve now added the fifth and final (for now) tutorial:\nCreate a layer in the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Placenames using metadata from Trove’s digitised maps\nAs has been the way in a lot of TDG development, this tutorial builds on and extends resources available through the GLAM Workbench. The Trove maps section of the GLAM Workbench already included a dataset of digitised maps and their coordinates, but for this tutorial I added a notebook that lets you create a subset of maps relating to a particular region. It does this by putting all the available map locations on world map. You then draw a rectangle on the map to select a region and display details of all the maps whose centre points fall within that region. It also displays links to download your new dataset as either a CSV or GeoJSON file.\n\r\nThe tutorial walks you through this process, then demonstrates how you can upload data from the CSV file to create a new layer in the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Placenames (GHAP).\n\r\nThis part of the Trove Data Guide project is now finished, but I’ll be continuing to add and refine content. If you have any suggestions for additional tutorials, feel free to add them to the ideas board (no promises though!).",

I’ve added a tutorial which walks through the process of using a GLAM Workbench notebook to extract and process data from a Trove List, before uploading it to CollectionBuilder to create an instant exhibition.\n\r\nCollectionBuilder creates online exhibitions using static web technologies. It provides a GitHub Pages template repository, so all you need to do to create an exhibition is upload your metadata and images to GitHub. The GLAM Workbench notebook gets your list data from the Trove API, and enriches it a bit to take advantage of CollectionBuilder’s built-in visualisations. For example, if there’s any digitised maps in your list, the notebook will try and extract their coordinates from the digitised map viewer and add them to the metadata so that CollectionViewer can display the location on a map. The notebook also downloads images of newspaper articles and other digitsed resources, and links them to the metadata, ready for upload.\nCheck out the tutorial: Sharing a Trove List as a CollectionBuilder exhibition",

          "description": "I’ve just added a couple of new notebooks to the Trove Newspaper & Gazette Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench.\nUsing the Trove Harvester as a Python package provides a basic example of using the trove-newspaper-harvester Python package. While there’s already a simple web app version of the harvester, I wanted a notebook version running in the JupyterLab interface that I could integrate with other tools and notebooks. All you need to do to harvest all the articles in a Trove newspaper search is paste in your Trove API key and the search query url from the Trove web interface.\n\r\nReshaping your newspaper harvest provides a slice and dice wonder tool for Trove newspaper harvests, enabling you to repackage OCRd text by decade, year, and  newspaper title. It saves the results as zip files, concatenated text files, or CSV files with embedded text. These repackaged slices should  suit a variety of text analysis tools and questions. I’ve be thinking about doing something like this for a while, and think it should be quite useful.\nIn my usual way, I started off writing a tutorial for the Trove Data Guide on ways of loading digitised newspaper data into text analysis tools and then realised I needed these notebooks to fill in some gaps in the data processing pipeline. So after a day or two of yak shaving I now have to get back to the tutorial.",

By going beyond traditional narratives of labour and economy, we seek to examine how these realms intersect with societal dynamics, identity formation, and community cohesion.\nMigration has long served as a conduit for the exchange and diffusion of sporting traditions, artistic expressions, and cultural identities across borders and continents. Similarly, sports, culture and arts serve as powerful mediums through which migrants navigate and negotiate their identities, fostering inclusion among migrant populations. This dynamic exchange between migration and what lies beyond work not only shapes the cultural landscapes of host nations but also enriches the global fabric of human experience.\nThe annual event is co-organised by the Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations Humaines (CDMH), a long-time AEMI member; the Ville de Dudelange and the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH).\n \nSee the detailed programme.\n \n25-28  September 2024\nTown Hall, Salle Nic Birtz, Dudelange\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/diddeleng_gemeng_web.jpg?itok=c1UWVcQk\n  34th AEMI (Association of European migration institutions) conference.\n  25 September 2024 to 28 September 2024\n  Contemporary history of Luxembourg  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Migration history  Transnationalism\n  Conferences\n  Published  \nPhoto by Cornischong [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons.",

          "description": "Many questions are currently being asked about the practice of history: archives are being transformed, tools have changed, as have the logics and players involved in disseminating historical research. How do we choose among the many paths open to us today? The “Taste of the archive in the digital age” project, carried out since 2017 with Frédéric Clavert, aimed in part to describe these new practices of history; it led to a reflection on the nature of the links that bind us to the archive. Certain parts of this documentation have become unstable, such as “family” archives, which have hitherto survived in attics or trunks, and are now flows that disappear at the same time as our smartphones and their photo albums. Around these questions gravitate “worlds”: archivists, the “public”, students, publishers... what specific contributions can historians make in this galaxy?\n \nMonday, 23 September 2024\n16.30 - 17.30\n\"Aquarium\", Maison des Sciences humaines\n11, Porte des Sciences\nL-4366 Luxembourg\nand online\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/carile_muller_full_width.jpg?itok=Jz0SRPJW\n  Talk by Caroline Muller, Université de Rennes.\n  23 September 2024\n  Public history\n  Archives  Digital hermeneutics  Digital methods  Digitisation\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Led by Myriam Dalal and Thomas Cauvin, researchers from the University of Luxembourg, this project uses oral history and art to give a voice to several Portuguese-speaking grandmothers residing in Esch-sur-Alzette, who have made this city their home.\nLOVÓ explores the personal stories of these remarkable women, weaving a link between the private and public spheres, and between the individual and the collective. These grandmothers play an essential role as bearers of intangible cultural heritage, tran…",

          "description": "Over the past several decades, great strides have been made to democratize public history. As one of the main cultural sites where public history is engaged, museums play a critical role in not only educating the public, but, increasingly, learning from the public about the past, and its significance in the present and future. Ongoing calls for deeper and more diverse forms of participation, power sharing, and collaboration have brought a wider range of perspectives and participants into the processes of producing history for public engagement. But museum practitioners’ engagement with children often remains stuck in outmoded, hierarchical dynamics that fail to recognize children’s capacities as contributors and collaborators in public historical work.

Across the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, an estimated 1,600 communities of color were destroyed by highway construction. Rondo was one of these neighborhoods, sacrificed to the asphalt as cities across the country weaponized their arteries by building “white roads through Black bedrooms.”\nMarvin Anderson remembers what the City of St. Paul did to his neighborhood, and he has made it his life’s mission to Remember Rondo. In 2015, Mr. Anderson and Rebecca Wingo joined forces to create RememberingRondo.org, a vibrant history hub with a community-based digital archive, a map of Rondo’s historic businesses, and much more.

But while historians and archivists share a common interest in archived information, their vision of material relevance and record-keeping occasionally differ. Additionally to this ancient divide, digital archiving has brought new challenges for both communities.\nIn this paper, I will first discuss conceptual continuity lines between analog and digital archiving of textual material at a general level. In a second step, I will examine both analog and digital archiving under the lens of their environmental footprint and the challenges it brings about in a context of resource shortage like the climate and biodiversity crisis.

Researchers still find it difficult to assess their own achievements from a historical perspective.

          "description": "In his proposal for the Dartmouth summer research project (1955-1956), Nathaniel Rochester wondered whether injecting some randomness into a machine could make it creative. But how to control this randomness to prevent machines crashing and ensure the generated content’s relevance ? Seventy years later, the so-called « generative AI » seems to have solved the problem, or at least circumvented some obstacles. Despite the difficulty of estimating what goes on inside deep neural networks, we will briefly describe what « creativity » is about in generative AIs (interpolation in a latent space) and the current controversy over how to evaluate it using dedicated benchmarks. Then, drawing from literature and philosophy (Borges, Caillois, Bachelard), we will challenge the claim that it can be compared to human creativity. Finally, we will examine how these machines don’t have to be creative like humans to trigger an epochal change that we need to characterize.\nAlban Leveau-Vallier is a postdoctoral researcher at University Paris 8 and lecturer at Sciences Po Paris, he recently published IA, l’intuition et la création à l’épreuve des algorithmes (Champ Vallon).\n \nWednesday, 12 June 2024\n15.00  16.30\nBlack Box, Maison des Sciences humaines\nBelval Campus\n11, Porte des Sciences\nL-4366 Esch-sur-Alzette\nand online\n \n\n\n12 June 2024\n  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Artificial  intelligence\n  Conferences\n  Published  \nPhoto by Andrea De Santis from Unsplash, modified by AI.",

          "description": "Do we play video games or do video games play us? Is nonhuman play a mere paradox or the future of gaming? And what do video games have to do with quantum theory? In the talk based on her book Playing at a Distance (MIT Press 2022), Sonia Fizek will engage with these questions, proposing new ways to think about games and play that decenter the human player and explore a variety of play formats and practices that require surprisingly little human action. Idling in clicker games, wandering in walking simulators, automating gameplay with bots, or simply watching games rather than playing them—Fizek will argue that these seemingly marginal cases are central to understanding how we play in the digital age.\n13 June 2024\n\n  \n  \n\n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n    \nSonia Fizek is a media and games scholar. She holds a professorship in Media and Game Studies at the Cologne Game Lab at TH Köln – University of Applied Sciences. Fizek is also a visiting professor at the University of Lower Silesia in Wroclaw (Poland)  and a co-editor-in-chief of the international Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds. In her latest book Playing at a Distance (MIT Press 2022), she explores the borderlands of video game aesthetic with focus on automation, AI and posthuman forms of play. Fizek’s current research concentrates on the environmental aspects of video games. She participates in two international projects: “STRATEGIES – Sustainable Transition for Europe’s Game Industries” (2024-2027), and “Greening Games.

          "description": "The Family of Man was an exhibition of some five hundred photographs from around the world, curated by Edward Steichen for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York in 1955. After its installation at MoMA, and under the auspices of the United States Information Agency, copies of the exhibition then toured close to fifty countries. By the end of its international tour the exhibition had been seen by almost ten million people, making it the most successful event of the early decades of the cultural Cold War. This paper will consider the international reception of The Family of Man. Taking India and Japan as case studies, it will suggest the ways in which intersection of Steichen’s work and conception with local social and political circumstances inflected and reshaped the meanings of the exhibition.\n \n\n\n \nShamoon Zamir is Professor of Literature and Art history at New York University Abu Dhabi.

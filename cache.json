As such, it offers a unique opportunity to reward individual projects that either have been formative or had a decisive impact on the field as a whole. Because the prize is awarded to the overall project, the recipients can be a single individual or a collaborative group of scholars, researchers, and/or practitioners. The output recognized can take any form: published research, developed resources, an established initiative, and/or center or tool(s) for research, for example. To be eligible for the prize, the nominated project must involve the innovative scholarly use of information and communications technologies.\nWe urge you, as members of the field, to take this opportunity to offer recommendations for outstanding work that you feel deserves recognition. Nominations will be accepted until 23:59 UTC on 01 September 2021. A winner will be announced during the winter of 2021-2022 and the prize will be awarded at the 2022 DH conference.\nNominations should consist of a document (1500-2000 words) describing the work to be nominated and the individual(s) involved, paying special attention to the relevance and importance of this work to the field as a whole. Please include a brief description of the work, a discussion of its innovative use of information technology and, particularly, the importance of this project to the Digital Humanities. Self-nominations will not be accepted. Please address nominations to the ADHO Awards Committee and send electronic copies to awards [at] adho [dot] org.\nNote: Any previous nominations should be resubmitted.\nFor further information, including the terms of the award and protocols for its selection, please visit ADHO’s Zampolli Prize web page.\n\n\nPost Date: \n\nWednesday, March 10, 2021",

Any image (and even audio and video) can become a IIIF object by building a manifest that uses the IIIF standard to describe its",

She focuses on social behaviour analysed on the basis of communication arising from social media data. She claims that data ownership is key to digital and environmental sustainability.\nSocial media data\nIn this webinar Monachesi presents the computational methodology she developed to analyse social media data that exploits the linguistic, communicative and relational characteristics of the users. She focuses on two communities: creative migrants and elderly. In order to reveal the more implicit meaning of the data, she combines her quantitative analysis with a qualitative, thematic analysis in a novel mixed-method approach based on an explanatory sequential emergent design.\nPodcast and debate\nAttendants will listen to 3 podcasts of about 10-15 mins addressing the methodology. There will be space to ask questions and have a debate about the approach, results of the analysis and the relation between digital and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, there will be the possibility to comment and give feedback on the podcast series.",

          "description": "Introduction: This article explores the potential use of data-driven methods to visualise and interpret the impact of Western efforts to influence Cold War dynamics using a covert book distribution programme. Based on a documentary corpus connected to the 2013 book by Alfred Reisch, which documented efforts by the CIA to disseminate books in the Soviet Bloc in the period 1956-1971, the authors use the Tableau Public platform to re-assess information science methods for researching historical events. Their analysis suggests that books distributed did not tend to have a more obvious political slant, but were more likely to have a broader universalist outlook. While it skirts around some of the limitations of visualization (highlighted elsewhere by Drucker and others) it offers a solid introduction to the benefits of a data-driven approach to a general audience.",

          "description": "Introduction: In this paper, Ehrlicher et al. follow a quantitative approach to unveil possible structural parallelisms between 13 comedies and 10 autos sacramentales written by Calderón de la Barca. Comedies are analyzed within a comparative framework, setting them against Spanish comedia nueva and French comedie precepts. Authors employ tool DramaAnalysis and statistics for their examination, focusing on: word frequency per subgenre, average number of characters, their variation and discourse distribution, etc. Autos sacramentales are also evaluated through these indicators. Regarding comedies, Ehrlicher et al.’s results show that Calderón: a) plays with units of space and time depending on creative and dramatic needs, b) does not follow French comedie conventions of character intervention or linkage, but c) does abide by its concept of structural symmetry. As for autos sacramentales, their findings brought forth that these have a similar length and character variation to comedies. However, they also identified the next difference: Calderón uses character co-presence in them to reinforce the message conveyed. Considering all this, authors confirm that Calderón’s comedies disassociate from classical notions of theatre – both Aristotelian and French –ideals. With respect to autos sacramentales, they believe further evaluation would be needed to verify ideas put forward and identify other structural patterns.",

This book chapter describes a web-based tool called CATMA which  promises a \"low-threshold\" approach to digitally encoded text interpretation. CATMA has a long trajectory based on a 'standoff' approach to markup, somewhat provocatively described by its creators as \"undogmatic\", which stands in contrast to more established systems for text representation in digital scholarly editing and publishing such as XML markup, or the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Standoff markup involves applying numbers to each character of a text and then using those numbers as identifiers to store interpretation externally. This approach allows for \"multip…",

Through the application of eXtreme Design (XD), ArCO basically consists in an ontology network comprising seven modules (the arco, the core, the catalogue, the location, the denotative description, the context description, and the cultural event) and a set of LOD data comprising a huge amount of linked entities referring to the national Italian cultural resources, properties and events. Under constant refinement, ArCo represents an example of a \"robust Semantic Web resource\" (Carriero et al., 11) in the field of cultural heritage, along with other projects like, just to mention a couple of them, the Google Arts&Culture (https://artsandculture.google.com/) or the Smithsonian American Art Museum (https://americanart.si.edu/about/lod).\n\n[Click ‘Read more’ for the full post!]",

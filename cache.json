At the same time, working groups such as the CEI have been considering the possibilities of a standard to encode medieval and early modern charters in XML, inserting diplomatics’ concepts and charter-specific markup into the framework of the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines. Hopefully, these developments allow for the interoperability of tools and resources specific to this type of documentation, promoting the replication of well-succeeded experiences in other corpora and historical traditions.…",

We are looking for participants to join us in a day of making, research and reflection with the physical materials that underpin AI systems. Those that are conventionally considered to ‘make’ AI through the design of AI systems are largely divorced from AI’s materiality and the craft of making AI. We hope to push participants beyond the theoretical knowing of AI materiality to tactile knowing through a practice-based approach to ‘making’ AI. Reorienting the focus of AI to materials and the supply chain as sites of creative intervention could leverage the potential of sensory, tactile experiences to spur re-imaginations of AI technologies and infrastructures.\nhttps://aiyesterday.com/ACM-C-C-Workshop\n \nProject Team: Margaret McGrath, Nancy Salem, Laurel Boxall\nFunders: TORCH-Minderoo Fund in AI Governance",

          "description": "This dataset includes derived data on a collection of ca. 2,700 books in English published between 2001–2021 and spanning 12 different genres. The data was manually collected to capture popular writing aimed at a range of different readerships across fiction (1,934) and non-fiction (820). Genres include forms of cultural capital (bestsellers, prizewinners, elite book reviews), stylistic affinity (mysteries, science fiction, biography, etc.), and age-level (middle-grade and young adult). The dataset allows researchers to explore the effects of audience, genre, and instrumentality (i.e., fictionality) on the stylistic behavior of authors within the recent past across different classes of professionally published writing.\n Published on 2022-10-11 11:46:08",

          "description": "In this paper we present the first-ever procedure for identifying highly similar sequences of text in Chinese and Tibetan translations of Buddhist sūtra literature. We initially propose this procedure as an aid to scholars engaged in the philological study of Buddhist documents. We create a cross-lingual embedding space by taking the cosine similarity of average sequence vectors in order to produce unsupervised similar cross-linguistic parallel alignments at word, sentence, and even paragraph level. Initial results show that our method lays a solid foundation for the future development of a fully-fledged Information Retrieval tool for these (and potentially other) low-resource historical languages.\n Published on 2022-10-04 11:18:29",

          "description": "The digital representation and publishing of human history on the web has so far been stuck at the digital unlocking of collections of historical items. Those collections are described by metadata mostly for curation and for findability metadata that are put on the web in the manner of a library catalog. Usually, there is little on ‘aboutness’. This is unfortunate, as modern representations of knowledge and web-based interactive presentation techniques offer ample opportunities for a more complex representation and richer interaction with digital history. In this contribution, we argue for a history in digital data that is treated for what it is: an interpretation, like all history, while remaining traceable to its information carriers.\n Published on 2022-09-02 10:08:20",

          "description": "Drama Critiques’ dataset was produced as part of Mylène Maignant’s PhD project at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (Ulm) between 2018 and 2022. Her research aims to explore the reception of contemporary London theatre (2010 to 2020) by analysing a large corpus based on the reviews written by two distinct groups of theatre critics: the journalistic one on the one hand, and the digital one on the other hand (bloggers). By relying partly on the data made available by Theatre Record (https://www.theatrerecord.com/) and by automatically extracting the content of 28 blogs, we built a corpus constituting more than 40,000 theatre reviews. Only 36,000 are open access, as some of the bloggers have not given their authorisation yet. The purpose of this data collection consisted of exploring the similarities and differences between these two literary communities. We were interested in better understanding the cultural discourse both journalists and bloggers construct. Given the amount of data, we relied on digital technologies to investigate this field. Using various digital techniques, such as computational linguistics, sentiment analysis, and Geographic Information Systems, we conducted a number of different analyses to map this cultural phenomenon. If some publications have already tackled the literary theme of English digital theatre criticism, none of them have examined it from a computational perspective. Drama Critiques’ dataset is then the first corpus which not only offers so many contemporary reviews based on journalists and bloggers’ publications, but which also proposes a study of its content (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6799656).\nRepository location: 10.5281/zenodo.6799656.\n Published on 2022-08-25 10:40:45",

Achieving this goal means meeting scientific requirements (that methods be comparable and replicable) and requirements for collaboration (that multi-disciplinary teams can reliably access data). To support those requirements, access to consistent reference datasets is needed. Unfortunately, these datasets are not openly available in a format that supports their use in data science.

          "description": "In common with many technical aspects of digital humanities, the TEI has a reputation for being difficult to teach and difficult to learn, with potential practitioners put off by the large and (at first sight) intimidating set of guidelines, the seemingly complex hierarchical structure and the profusion of angle brackets. One-to-one or small group teaching in the context of a specific project is often the preferred method, where the short but steep learning curve required to engage with the TEI can be addressed in a way which is relevant to the aims and experience of the learner. This, however, is not a particularly efficient way of teaching. In this article, the authors discuss their experience of teaching (and learning) the TEI, and how lessons learned in contexts relating to specific projects might feed into the teaching of TEI in a more general setting – the Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School being the prime example.\n Published on 2022-05-24 13:09:19",

          "description": "This paper pioneers a new computational approach for the study of changes in shape of objects across time. Previously, such a study was undertaken by scholars using a purely visual approach and relied on images of objects or in-person observations. This paper’s approach is based on 3D scans of historical artefacts. Sample points are extracted from these 3D scans and the distance between analogous points across different objects is computed using an approximation of the Wasserstein metric, namely the Sinkhorn distance. In this paper, the approach is demonstrated on a small set of ancient Greek vessels of the Krater, Pelike, and Kylix types, as the variation in their shapes across time is well known to archaeologists. Results offer, for the first time, a way of quantifying differences between objects. Benefits of this approach lie in its ability to quantify change, to study complex 3D material, and to analyse large datasets of objects, opening the possibility of constructing new large-scale studies of object shape across time and geographical regions. These have a range of applications in art history, archaeology, digital humanities, museology and extended reality studies.\n Published on 2022-05-20 12:09:58",

The participant interview data relies on a narrative inquiry methodology and is collected in one-on-one interviews with researchers on the theme of anglophone expatriation and adaptation to French socio-physical space. These interviews are informal and interactive, aiming for a sharing of experience, since the researchers are, themselves, anglophone expatriates. The aim of this accompanying article is to provide information on the dataset through a concomitant reflection on the research context in France and the affordances of the increasingly powerful TGIR Huma-Num digital humanities infrastructure, as well as the tensions that are prevalent in the Franco-European space between the demands of Open Science and the restrictions of the European General Data Protection Regulations.

          "description": "Using the reparation movement for Japanese colonial and wartime atrocities as a case study, this paper explores the applicability of graph database management systems to network analysis research and teaching in the field of digital humanities. Since the late 1980s, Asian victims of Japanese colonial and wartime atrocities (such as the infamous “comfort women” system) began to sue the Japanese government and corporations with the help of local and Japanese lawyers and activists. This paper uses the plethora of publicly available court materials produced by the movement to study social networks in this transnational historical justice movement and illustrate how graph database management systems can upgrade traditional network analysis methodologies in digital humanities. By inputting the data about lawsuits and lawyers in the movement into graph database applications like Neo4j and GraphXR, the paper demonstrates the advantages of managing network data in graph database structure in terms of scalability, modifiability, intuitive visibility, query efficiency, and analysis potential over relational database structure, which is the mainstream in network analysis research.\n Published on 2022-04-25 13:37:52",

[...]The concept of LoGaRT - treating local gazetteers as “databases” by themselves - is an innovative and pertinent way to articulate the essence of the platform: providing opportunities for multi-level analysis from the close reading of the sources (using, for example, the carousel mode) to the large-scale, “bird’s eye view” of the materials across geographical and temporal boundaries. Local gazetteers are predominantly textual sources – this characteristic of the collection is reflected in the capabilities of LoGaRT as well, since some of its key capabilities include data search (using Chinese characters), collection and analysis, as well as tagging and dataset comparison. That said, LoGaRT also offers integrated visualization tools and supports the expansion of the collection and tagging features to the images used in a number of gazetteers. The opportunity to smoothly intertwine these visual and textual collections with Chinese historical maps (see CHMap) is an added, and much welcome, advantage of the tool, which helps to develop sophisticated and multifaceted analyses.\n[Click ‘Read more’ for the full post!]",

          "description": "Introduction: Open Refine, the freely accessible successor to Google Refine, is an ideal tool for cleaning up data series and thus obtaining more sustainable results. Entries can be searched in alphabetical order or sorted by frequency, so that typing errors or slightly different variants can be easily found and adjusted. For example, with the help of the software, I discovered two such discrepancies in my Augustinian Correspondence Database, which I am now able to correct with one click in the programme. I was shown that I had noted \"As a reference to Jerome's letter it's not counted\" five times and \"As a reference to Jerome's letter, it's not counted\" three times. Consequently, if I searched the database for this expression, I would not see all the results. A second discrepancy was between the entry \"continuing reference (marked by Nam)\" and the entry \"continuing reference (marked by nam)\". Thanks to Open Refine, such errors can be completely avoided in the future.\n\nThe tutorial by Miriam Posner is a useful introduction to come in touch with the software. However, the first step of the installation is already out of date. While version 3.1 was still the latest when the tutorial was published, it is now version 3.5.2. Under Windows, you can now distinguish between a version that requires Java and a version with embedded OpenJDK Java, which I found very pleasing.\n\nIf needed, there are links at the end of the tutorial to other introductions that go into more depth.",

We seek to understand the ways in which the canon of Russian literature was conceptualized and composed differently in different translated contexts; to query Pascale Casanova’s claim that Paris was the most important “capital” of the “World Republic of Letters”; and to determine which other locales played a significant role in the process of a “peripheral” literature’s incorporation into “world literature” in the space of less than a century.\n19C RLT currently tracks book publications of works by Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky into English, French, and German from the death of Pushkin in 1837 to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, comprising a growing database as well as maps, graphs, and other visualizations of the data. Future phases are planned to add more authors and expand the scope to include other global contexts in which Russian literature became an important translated literature in the twentieth century and beyond.\nContributors:\nScott Bartling\nAndrew Basile\nRachel Dennis\nEmily Despinoy\nCatherine Fantuzzo\nAisha Garaeva\nEkaterina Kokovikhina\nSergey Miroshkin\nJan Nowak\nLydia Shaw\nEugenia Ulanova\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert an Image: \n\n\n\n\nCo-Investigators: \n\nHilah Kohen (Penn)\nOlga Nechaeva (Penn)\nJ.D.

          "description": "Detecting Genre in Pitchfork Reviews\n\n\nProject Start Date: \n\nAugust, 2021\n\n\n\nWe analyze 23,000 reviews from Pitchfork.com to establish a network of over 7,000 artists based on their co-presence in reviews. We use Gephi's (Louvain community detection) modularity class feature to sort the network into closely connected groups. However, because this process is non-deterministic, we improve on its results by running it 10,000 times. Using this novel \"metamodularity\" method we can show how often any two artists were sorted into the same group. For instance, the jazz musician Alice Coltrane was grouped with John Coltrane 10,000 times, with Sly and the Family Stone 4,939 times, and with Guns n’ Roses one time. With these data, we can visualize how the largely undifferentiated mass of artists fragments into more and more connected groups could be described as genres. \nWhile some of the genres suggested by this method are incredibly specific, one notable exception is the group of African American musicians, which is remarkably large and stable. The artists within it range from Flying Lotus to Motown legend Marvin Gaye to trap rapper Young Thug to R&B singer-songwriter Sade to gangster rapper Tupac Shakur to funk innovators Funkadelic to cross-over hip hop star Cardi B. This is a far more capacious group than most rock clusters along aesthetic, market, and even historic grounds. This may reflect real world connections, yet it is also possible that this metamodularity difference reflects a bias at Pitchfork, where a (historically) rock-oriented hipster aesthetic and a (historically) largely white male audience may correspond to a relative lack of nuance when covering Black artists (historically). In any case, it is fair to say based on these data that Pitchfork has written about Black artists in a structurally unique way over the years relative to their coverage of white artists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert an Image: \n\n\n\n\nProject Principal Investigator: \n\nJ.D.

His dissertation examines the mukhaḍramūn—a generation of poets who lived between the pre-Islamic and Islamic era—focusing on the network of emotions surrounding the poetic experience of existing in the threshold of transition, known as khaḍramah. Drawing from theories of affect and emotion, he departs from a historical study of the mukhaḍramūn to develop a theory of khaḍramah that examines how this experience, vis-a-vis biography and anecdote, informs transformations in poetic forms indigenous to the Arabic language. Using optical character recognition and text analysis software, Rawad is compiling a digital archive of poetry collections central to his research to facilitate analysis of linguistic, stylistic, and formal patterns to explore new methods of close and distant reading. Rawad earned two MA degrees in Arabic from the University of Texas at Austin (2017) and the University of California, Los Angeles (2013). He was awarded a fellowship for the Center of Arabic Study Abroad (2014) in Amman, Jordan. Rawad received a Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship Dissertation Abroad Request (2021), Janet Lee Stevens Award in Arabic and Islamic Studies (2020) and was named a Mellon Graduate Fellow (2019).

          "description": "The Trove Newspaper Harvester has been around in different forms for more than a decade. It helps you download all the articles in a Trove newspaper search, opening up new possibilities for large-scale analysis. You can use it as a command-line tool by installing a Python package, or through the Trove Newspaper Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench.\nI’ve just overhauled development of the Python package. The new trove-newspaper-harvester replaces the old troveharvester repository. The command-line interface remains the same (with a few new options), so it’s really a drop in replacement. Read the full documentation of the new package for more details.\n\nHere’s a summary of the changes:\nthe package can now be used as a library (that you incorporate into your own code) as well as a standalone command-line tool – this means you can embed the harvester in your own tools or workflows\nboth the library and the CLI now let you set the names of the directories in which your harvests will be saved – this makes it easier to organise your harvests into groups and give them meaningful names\nthe harvesting process now saves results into a newline-delimited JSON file (one JSON object per line) – the library has a save_csv() option to convert this to a CSV file, while the CLI automatically converts the results to CSV to maintain compatibility with previous versions\nbehind the scenes, the package is now developed and maintained using nbdev – this means the code and documentation are all generated from a set of Jupyter notebooks\nthe Jupyter notebooks include a variety of automatic tests which should make maintenance and development much easier in the future\nI’ve also updated the Trove Newspaper Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench to use the new package. The new core library will make it easier to develop more complex harvesting examples – for example, searching for articles from a specific day across a range of years. If you find any problems, or want to suggest improvements, please raise an issue.",

          "description": "A few weeks ago I created a new search interface to the NSW Post Office Directories from 1886 to 1908. Since then, I’ve used the same process on the Sydney Telephone Directories from 1926 to 1954. Both of these publications had been digitised by the State Library of NSW and made available through Trove. To build the new interfaces I downloaded the text from Trove, indexed it by line, and linked it back to the online page images.\nBut there are similar directories from other states that are not available through Trove. The Tasmanian Post Office Directory, for example, has been digitised between 1890 and 1948 and made available as 48 individual PDF files from Libraries Tasmania. While it’s great that they’ve been digitised, it’s not really possible to search them without downloading all the P…",

The directories list residences and businesses by name and street location. Using them we can explore changes in the use of Parramatta Road across 60 years of history. But there’s a problem. While you can browse the directories page by page, searching is clunky. Trove’s main search indexes the contents of the directories by ‘article’.

It took me a while to figure out, but it seems that the search index was rebuilt on 31 May, and that caused some major shifts in the distribution of articles by state, as reported by the main result API. So the indexing of the articles changed, not the actual number of articles. Interestingly, the number of articles by state reported by the newspaper API doesn’t show the same fluctuations.\n\nThis adds another layer of complexity to understanding how Trove changes over time. To try and document such things, I’ve added a ‘Significant events’ section to the Dashboard. I’ve also included a new ‘Total articles by publication state’ section that compares results from the result and newspaper APIs. This should make it easier to identify such issues in the future.\nStay alert people – remember, search interfaces lie!",

Using it, you can save metadata and digital resources to your own research database with a single click. Libraries Tasmania actually has three catalogues rolled into one – the main library catalogue, the Archives catalogue, and the Names Index. The translator works across all three. Features include:\nSelect and save items from a page of search results.\nSave individual items across the full range of formats. (By default, individual records in the catalogue open in a modal overlay. For Zotero to recognise the item you need to click on the Permalink button and open the record on a separate page.)\nAutomatically download digital images and PDFs attached to records. This works when the record points to a particular page – it won’t download multiple images from a single link. However, if a record contains multiple links to digitised pages (such as the Convict records in the Names Index), you’ll get them all!\nFields in the Archives catalogue and Name Index that don’t map to Zotero properties are saved as key/value pairs in Zotero’s ‘Extra’ field\n\nThe translator is now included in the main Zotero repository so should install and update itself automatically. If the Zotero browser extension doesn’t seem to be detecting Libraries Tasmania items you can force an update by right clicking on the Zotero icon in your browser toolbar and clicking on Preferences > Advanced > Update translators.\nMy work on this translator was not entirely altruistic – it’s going to be very useful in the Everyday Heritage project as Kate Bagnall and I try to bring together sources relating to Chinese heritage in Tasmania.\nBut I’m also very happy to be able to update my spreadsheet of Zotero support in Australian GLAM organisations and put Libraries Tasmania in the green! #dhhacks",

          "description": "I’ve created a Zotero translator for the Libraries Tasmania catalogue. Using it, you can save metadata and digital resources to your own research database with a single click. Libraries Tasmania actually has three catalogues rolled into one – the main library catalogue, the archives catalogue, and the names index. The translator works across all three. Features include:\nSelect and save items from a page of search results.\nSave individual items across the full range of formats. (By default, individual records in the catalogue open in a modal overlay. For Zotero to recognise the item you need to click on the Permalink button and open the record on a separate page.)\nAutomatically download digital images and PDFs attached to records. This works when the record points to a particular page – it won’t download multiple images from a single link. However, if a record contains multiple links to digitised pages (such as the Convict records in the Names Index), you’ll get them all!\nFields in the Archives catalogue and Name Index that don’t map to Zotero properties are saved as key/value pairs in Zotero’s ‘Extra’ field\n\nI’ve submitted the translator for inclusion in the official repository, but you’re welcome to take it for a test run in the meantime. Just follow these steps:\nFind out where your Zotero data folder is. From Zotero go to Edit > Preferences > Advanced > Files and Folders and click on Show Data Directory.\nOpen the translator file here. Then right click and choose Save as, navigate to your Zotero data folder, and save it in the ‘translators’ folder.\nRestart Zotero and your browser.\nHead to the Libraries Tasmania catalogue and try it!\nLet me know if you strike any problems. #dhhacks",

I particularly like how easy Datasette makes it to publish datasets on cloud services like Google’s Cloudrun and Heroku. A couple of weekends ago I migrated the TungWah Newspaper Index to Datasette. It’s now running on Heroku, and I can push updates to it in seconds.\nI’m also using Datasette as the platform for sharing data from the Sydney Stock Exchange Project that I’m working on with the ANU Archives. There’s a lot of data – more than 20 million rows – but getting it running on Google Cloudrun was pretty straightforward with Datasette’s publish command. The problem was, however, that…",

The proxy app then redirects you to the Trove API Console so you can see the results of the API query without needing a key.\nTo make it easy to use, I created a bookmarklet that encodes your current url and feeds it to the proxy. To use it just:\nDrag this link to your bookmarks toolbar: Open Trove API Console.\nRun a search in Trove’s newspapers.\nClick on the bookmarklet.\nThis little hack provides a bit of ‘glue’ to help researchers think their about search results as data, and explore other possibilities for download and analysis. #dhhacks",

          "description": "I’ve been doing a bit of cleaning up, trying to make some old datasets more easily available. In particular I’ve been pulling together harvests of the number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state. My first harvests date all the way back to 2011, before there was even a Trove API. Unfortunately, I didn’t run the harvests as often as I should’ve and there are some big gaps. Nonetheless, if you’re interested in how Trove’s newspaper corpus has grown and changed over time, you might find them useful. They’re available in this repository and also in Zenodo.\n\nThis chart shows how the number of newspaper articles per year in Trove has changed from 2011 to 2022. Note the rapid growth between 2011 and 2015.\nTo try and make sure that there’s a more consistent record from now on, I’ve also created a new Git Scraper – a GitHub repository that automatically harvests and saves data at weekly intervals. As well as the number of articles by year and state, it also harvests the number of articles by newspaper and category. As mentioned, these four datasets are updated weekly. If you want to get all the changes over time, you can retrieve earlier versions from the repository’s commit history.\nAll the datasets are CC-0 licensed and validated with Frictionless.\nThere’s also a notebook in the GLAM Workbench that explores this sort of data.",

Their strength lies in building connections to communities and collecting materials that will be critical to future generations of scholars. In documenting the pandemic (2020-22) A Journal of a Plague Year: An Archive of Covid-19 challenged the traditional approach to curating rapid-response archives seeking by assigning robust metadata to objects as they entered the archive. This archival metadata included curatorial tags, contributor tags, and in some cases community-assigned tags.

          "description": "In this presentation, Frédéric Calvert will talk about the COST action SlowMemo. At the core of this project lays the emergent concept of 'slow memory', that is intended to help us think from new angles about how societies and individuals remember the pasts that meaningfully affect their present and future. It begins from the premise that we are quite skilled (and have much practice) commemorating sudden or extreme events such as wars, atrocities or catastrophes. But we are less certain about how to reckon with slow-moving transformations that may be just as impactful, such as climate change, deindustrialization, or the gradual expansion of social and political rights.\n \nWednesday, 21 September 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space\n21 September 2022\n  Digital history & historiography\n  Digital methods  Methodology\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

The first phase of this project involved community workshops and crowdsourcing to collect photographs of potential objects to present at this exhibition. The second phase consisted of the categorisation of these objects by our Citizen Historian Circle (CHiC) and an online vote to select the objects for the exhibition.\nThe everyday objects bear witness to a personal approach to history. They tell the story of workers, sportsmen, or the distant past of the city. The free exhibition will showcase 25 of the most popular objects in the Pop-Up store in the shopping street of Esch-sur-Alzette. Each visitor will receive an exhibition catalogue in their preferred language (French, Luxembourgish or English) to read the personal anecdote and historical context of the object.\n \nOpening hours\n2 – 24 September, Monday – Saturday from 13.00-18.00.\nFree entrance.\nLocation\nPop-Up Store, 121 Rue de l'Alzette, 4011 Esch-sur-Alzette\nFor more information, visit our website at www.historesch.lu or contact us at info@historesch.lu.\n2 September 2022 to 24 September 2022\n  Public History as the New Citizen Science of the Past (PHACS)\n  Public History  Regional history\n  Outreach\n  Published  \nPhoto credits: Jo Diseviscourt",

However, it goes too far to take Curie’s presence as a proof for a gender sensitive museum practice. With initiatives like Queering Museums, museums start(ed) to discuss broader visions of gender diversity and queer(y)ing museum practices. But when and under what circumstances do museums begin to discuss what kind of gender knowledge they produce? How do museum makers reflect on gender gaps and biases in collections, exhibitions, and education, steering towards a more gender-informed museum making? Applying a Science and Technology Studies (STS) framework on selected case studies, this talk will discuss how museums put gender theory to practice and highlight the spatio-temporal situatedness of museum knowledge production about gender in historical perspective.\n \nWednesday, 29 June 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space and Webex\nIf you wish to participate, please send an e-mail to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link - or simply join us in person.\n29 June 2022\n  Public history\n  Cultural policies  Gender studies  Museology\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

In this talk I’ll describe some of our choices, and how it led to some unexpected scholarly insights—and moments of joy.\n \n\n\n \nAndrew Russell is a co-founder of The Maintainers with Lee Vinsel, in 2016. As a co-director, he works with Lee, Jessica, and Lauren on research projects, outreach, and a variety of organizational work that goes into maintaining the Maintainers. His background is in the history of technology, where he writes and teaches about subjects such as Internet history, technical standards, and technology in American life. He really enjoys seeing connections and patterns between maintenance in our personal lives and maintenance on broader scales, such as in organizations or state or national governments.\n \nMonday, 4 July 2022\n\n\n14.00 - 15.00\nHybrid event: C²DH Open Space and Webex\nIf you want to participate, just come to the 4th floor of the MSH or contact vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu for the Webex link.\n4 July 2022\n  Public history\n  Repairing technology – fixing society?

          "description": "Failures and breakdowns constitute an important element in the fundamental relationship between users and technology, and maintenance and repair are fundamental practices in everyday life. Stephen Graham and Nigel Thrift (2007) highlighted that “repair and maintenance are not incidental activities. In many ways, they are the engine room of modern economies and societies”. However, we still know very little about the actual developments of repair practices in the past and today. In his essay “Rethinking repair”, Steven Jackson (2014) therefore called for what he coined “broken world thinking”. He argues that we should take “erosion, breakdown, and decay, rather than novelty, growth, and progress, as our starting points” when we want to study consumption and use. Broken world thinking is an …",

          "description": "Soon after its creation in 2018 the Fondation Luxembourgeoise de la Mémoire de la Shoah asked the newly opened C²DH to conduct a doctoral research project on the “spoliation of Jewish property during World War II in Luxembourg”. The goal and methods of this project were slightly different from those of the Special Commission for the Study of the Spoliation of Jewish Property in Luxembourg during the war 1940-1945, which gave its final report to the Luxemburgish Government in 2009. The “road-book” of the project, in the form of a series of questions, was set by the convention that framed it, signed in 2019. But as the project unfolded, this frame had to evolve. Which sources were actually available? Which research question did we want to address? Which methods did we want to use?\nThis session of the Research Seminar will present how the project evolved since it started in January 2020 and which – sometimes very practical – challenges still lie ahead for its remaining 18 months.\n \nWednesday, 15 June 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space and Webex\nIf you wish to participate, please send an e-mail to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link - or simply join us in person.\n15 June 2022\n  Contemporary history of Luxembourg\n  History of the spoliation of Jewish property in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (1930s - 1950s)\n  Holocaust  Jewish history  WW2\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

For a century (approx. 1870-1970) the Minett was shaped by iron ore mining and the iron and steel industry. Rapid economic and population growth, urbanisation and labor migration have had a major impact on the history of the region, as have economic crises, environmental pollution and precarious housing and living conditions.\nRemixing Industrial Pasts in the Digital Age is a project of the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH ), launched in fall 2019 and funded by the European Capital of Culture Esch2022 asbl.\nThe \"Minett Stories\" virtual exhibition was developed in collaboration between the Remix team, Milan-based design studio Calibro and Bergamo-based software company Inmagik. The Remix team spent two and a half years researching and sourcing the underlying sources, designing the exhibition, and writing all the storyboards, scripts, story texts, and captions for the 22 exhibition chapters. The focus was on various forms of transmedia storytelling, including several interactive video documentaries, graphic novels, interactive maps, interactive podcasts, and two radio plays.

          "description": "The Charles Translator for Ukraine: A development by LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ\n\n            \nThe automatic translator for Czech and Ukrainian, recently developed at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÚFAL) of Charles University, is now also available as a mobile application for Android. Users can download the Charles Translator for Ukraine app free of charge from the Google Play store. \nThe translator was developed with support of the LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ, and runs on the LINDAT technical infrastructure. It was developed in record time after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent wave of refugees into the Czech Republic, and it has been freely available for non-commercial purposes since mid-March at https://translator.cuni.cz. The web service has logged almost a quarter of a million hits in April, which, together with the demand from owners of smart mobile devices running Android, has triggered the development of a mobile application. \nThe application allows translation between Czech and Ukrainian in both audio and text form, and phonetic transcriptions between Latin and Cyrillic are available for translations. \nThe release of the mobile application is a significant event in the historical context of research and development of machine translation at the ÚFAL and also at LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ. The importance of this moment was enhanced by the introduction of the new name of the Czech-Ukrainian translation system Charles Translator for Ukraine, thereby subscribing to the brand name Charles University. With the addition of translation pairs of languages, the name should be narrowed down to Charles Translator in the future, allowing the researchers from ÚFAL to combine this new translator, developed in connection with the war in Ukraine, with the existing translation service available in LINDAT for other languages.\n\n      Julia Misersky\n 17 June 2022",

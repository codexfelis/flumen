          "description": "A fairly intensive period of work came to an end today as I delivered a workshop on ‘Understanding Trove’ at the Australian Historical Association’s annual conference in Adelaide. In effect, the workshop was also the launch of the Trove Data Guide, which I’ve been developing as part of the ARDC’s Community Data Lab. The ARDC sponsored today’s workshop and has provided bursaries to help five ECRs and HDRs participate in the conference’s digital history stream.\nThanks to everyone who came to the workshop. It was great to have so much interest in developing a critical understanding of Trove and thinking about new research uses for Trove data. If you couldn’t make it, the slides are available below. Like the Trove Data Guide, the GLAM Workbench and pretty much everything else I do, the slides are openly licensed so feel free to share and reuse if any of it is useful to you.\n\nNow I think I need a day off before I start thinking about the topics I’d still like to add to the Trove Data Guide…",

          "description": "The Trove Data Guide aims to help researchers understand, access, and use data from Trove. But just because it’s about ‘data’ doesn’t mean  you need to be able to code. To understand Trove data and its  possibilities for research, you first need to understand Trove itself –  its history, its structure, its assumptions, and its limits. This  knowledge is useful to any Trove user.\nFor example, all Trove users would benefit from knowing more about works and versions, or how to use the ‘simple’ search box for complex queries. There’s also an introduction to what’s in (and not in) the digitised newspapers, and similar overviews for other digitised content such as books, parliamentary papers, and oral histories.\n\r\nNumber of newspapers articles in Trove by publication year, showing the change from 2011 to 2022\nSeveral sections document the way the web interface works (or doesn’t work). There’s a field guide to the various interfaces and identifiers you might come across, and details of options for downloading data. The Trove Data Guide fills many gaps in the official Trove  documentation, so check here if you run into problems, or can’t figure  out how to achieve a particular task. Perhaps you were wondering how to download digitised images at their highest available resolution?\nFor people who are more comfortable with code there are plenty of  useful snippets and complete working examples. For example there are  sections that document how to get metadata, text, and images from newspapers, and other digitised resources. There are also a series of ‘HOW TO’ pages that describe more complex data access methods.\nBut what can you do with Trove data? The Trove Data Guide’s Pathways provide detailed tutorials that lead you step by step through examples  of packaging Trove data for use with other digital tools. Use these  examples as a starting point in planning your own projects.",

          "description": "For this part of the ARDC’s Community Data Lab project, I’ve been focusing in particular on adding a series of researcher pathways to the Trove Data Guide. These pathways link data from Trove to a variety of tools and approaches and include five detailed tutorials. The first four were:\nAnalysing keywords in Trove’s digitised newspapers\nWorking with a Trove collection in Tropy\nComparing manuscript collections in Mirador\nSharing a Trove List as a CollectionBuilder exhibition\nI’ve now added the fifth and final (for now) tutorial:\nCreate a layer in the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Placenames using metadata from Trove’s digitised maps\nAs has been the way in a lot of TDG development, this tutorial builds on and extends resources available through the GLAM Workbench. The Trove maps section of the GLAM Workbench already included a dataset of digitised maps and their coordinates, but for this tutorial I added a notebook that lets you create a subset of maps relating to a particular region. It does this by putting all the available map locations on world map. You then draw a rectangle on the map to select a region and display details of all the maps whose centre points fall within that region. It also displays links to download your new dataset as either a CSV or GeoJSON file.\n\r\nThe tutorial walks you through this process, then demonstrates how you can upload data from the CSV file to create a new layer in the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Placenames (GHAP).\n\r\nThis part of the Trove Data Guide project is now finished, but I’ll be continuing to add and refine content. If you have any suggestions for additional tutorials, feel free to add them to the ideas board (no promises though!).",

You’d like to display the contents of your list as an online exhibition for others to explore. But how? One possible approach is now documented in the Trove Data Guide. I’ve added a tutorial which walks through the process of using a GLAM Workbench notebook to extract and process data from a Trove List, before uploading it to CollectionBuilder to create an instant exhibition.\n\r\nCollectionBuilder creates online exhibitions using static web technologies. It provides a GitHub Pages template repository, so all you need to do to create an exhibition is upload your metadata and images to GitHub. The GLAM Workbench notebook gets your list data from the Trove API, and enriches it a bit to take advantage of CollectionBuilder’s built-in visualisations. For example, if there’s any digitised maps in your list, the notebook will try and extract their coordinates from the digitised map viewer and add them to the metadata so that CollectionViewer can display the location on a map. The notebook also downloads images of newspaper articles and other digitsed resources, and links them to the metadata, ready for upload.\nCheck out the tutorial: Sharing a Trove List as a CollectionBuilder exhibition",

While there’s already a simple web app version of the harvester, I wanted a notebook version running in the JupyterLab interface that I could integrate with other tools and notebooks. All you need to do to harvest all the articles in a Trove newspaper search is paste in your Trove API key and the search query url from the Trove web interface.\n\r\nReshaping your newspaper harvest provides a slice and dice wonder tool for Trove newspaper harvests, enabling you to repackage OCRd text by decade, year, and  newspaper title. It saves the results as zip files, concatenated text files, or CSV files with embedded text. These repackaged slices should  suit a variety of text analysis tools and questions. I’ve be thinking about doing something like this for a while, and think it should be quite useful.\nIn my usual way, I started off writing a tutorial for the Trove Data Guide on ways of loading digitised newspaper data into text analysis tools and then realised I needed these notebooks to fill in some gaps in the data processing pipeline.

          "description": "About five years ago I created a collection of full-page editorial cartoons from The Bulletin, harvested from Trove. Through a process that might be politely described as ‘iterative’, I fiddled with an assortment of queries and methods until I had at least one cartoon from every issue published between 4 September 1886 and 17 September 1952 – 3,471 cartoons in total. The details of the collection and how I created it are available in the Trove periodicals section of the GLAM Workbench.\nLast night, as I was tidying up a new release of the Trove periodicals repository, I had a thought – why not put all of the details of the cartoons in a little database and make it available using Datasette-Lite for easy exploration? So I did.\nTry it now!\n\r\nOne of the coolest new features is that I’ve harvested the OCRd text from each page containing a cartoon and created a full-text index. This means you can find cartoons by searching for words in their captions! Other features include embedded thumbnail images and links to download high-resolution versions of each page image.\nIn creating the database, I realised there were a few problems with the original metadata (dodgy page numbers), so I’ve fixed that up as well. I’ve also moved the mega zip download of every image (over 60gb) from the unfortunately deceased CloudStor service to AWS.",

          "description": "Rondo is a predominantly African American neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota, with a familiar story. Across the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, an estimated 1,600 communities of color were destroyed by highway construction. Rondo was one of these neighborhoods, sacrificed to the asphalt as cities across the country weaponized their arteries by building “white roads through Black bedrooms.”\nMarvin Anderson remembers what the City of St. Paul did to his neighborhood, and he has made it his life’s mission to Remember Rondo. In 2015, Mr. Anderson and Rebecca Wingo joined forces to create RememberingRondo.org, a vibrant history hub with a community-based digital archive, a map of Rondo’s historic businesses, and much more.

But while historians and archivists share a common interest in archived information, their vision of material relevance and record-keeping occasionally differ. Additionally to this ancient divide, digital archiving has brought new challenges for both communities.\nIn this paper, I will first discuss conceptual continuity lines between analog and digital archiving of textual material at a general level. In a second step, I will examine both analog and digital archiving under the lens of their environmental footprint and the challenges it brings about in a context of resource shortage like the climate and biodiversity crisis.

Many of the epistemological and methodological questions we face today were already explored by previous generations. These explorations were often accompanied by rhetoric emphasizing the new, revolutionary, and disruptive nature of digital history. Researchers still find it difficult to assess their own achievements from a historical perspective.

          "description": "In his proposal for the Dartmouth summer research project (1955-1956), Nathaniel Rochester wondered whether injecting some randomness into a machine could make it creative. But how to control this randomness to prevent machines crashing and ensure the generated content’s relevance ? Seventy years later, the so-called « generative AI » seems to have solved the problem, or at least circumvented some obstacles. Despite the difficulty of estimating what goes on inside deep neural networks, we will briefly describe what « creativity » is about in generative AIs (interpolation in a latent space) and the current controversy over how to evaluate it using dedicated benchmarks. Then, drawing from literature and philosophy (Borges, Caillois, Bachelard), we will challenge the claim that it can be compared to human creativity. Finally, we will examine how these machines don’t have to be creative like humans to trigger an epochal change that we need to characterize.\nAlban Leveau-Vallier is a postdoctoral researcher at University Paris 8 and lecturer at Sciences Po Paris, he recently published IA, l’intuition et la création à l’épreuve des algorithmes (Champ Vallon).\n \nWednesday, 12 June 2024\n15.00  16.30\nBlack Box, Maison des Sciences humaines\nBelval Campus\n11, Porte des Sciences\nL-4366 Esch-sur-Alzette\nand online\n \n\n\n12 June 2024\n  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Artificial  intelligence\n  Conferences\n  Published  \nPhoto by Andrea De Santis from Unsplash, modified by AI.",

She holds a professorship in Media and Game Studies at the Cologne Game Lab at TH Köln – University of Applied Sciences. Fizek is also a visiting professor at the University of Lower Silesia in Wroclaw (Poland)  and a co-editor-in-chief of the international Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds. In her latest book Playing at a Distance (MIT Press 2022), she explores the borderlands of video game aesthetic with focus on automation, AI and posthuman forms of play. Fizek’s current research concentrates on the environmental aspects of video games. She participates in two international projects: “STRATEGIES – Sustainable Transition for Europe’s Game Industries” (2024-2027), and “Greening Games. Building Higher Education Resources for Sustainable Video Game Production, Design & Critical Game Studies” (2021-2024).\n \nThursday, 13 June 2024\n13:00 – 16:30\nAuditorium 3.330\nMaison du Savoir, Belval Campus\nand online\n \n\n\nPublic history\n  Public History\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "The Family of Man was an exhibition of some five hundred photographs from around the world, curated by Edward Steichen for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York in 1955. After its installation at MoMA, and under the auspices of the United States Information Agency, copies of the exhibition then toured close to fifty countries. By the end of its international tour the exhibition had been seen by almost ten million people, making it the most successful event of the early decades of the cultural Cold War. This paper will consider the international reception of The Family of Man. Taking India and Japan as case studies, it will suggest the ways in which intersection of Steichen’s work and conception with local social and political circumstances inflected and reshaped the meanings of the exhibition.\n \n\n\n \nShamoon Zamir is Professor of Literature and Art history at New York University Abu Dhabi.

          "description": "Suite aux travaux de la Commission spéciale pour l'étude des spoliations des biens juifs au Luxembourg pendant les années de guerre 1940-1945 (2001-2009), trois idées dominaient la compréhension de la dépossession des personnes considérées comme juives au Luxembourg pendant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale. La première, reprenant la phrase de Paul Cerf, était de penser qu’il n’y avait « point de Rothschild parmi les juifs luxembourgeois », autrement dit qu’il n’y avait pas de collection d’œuvres d’art parmi cette population. La deuxième était que les bénéficiaires de la dépossession furent les organisations allemandes et leurs soutiens. La troisième était que le montant global de la dépossession pouvait être évalué sur la base de la comptabilité du Chef der Zivilverwaltung, l’administration civile allemande. Par une approche microhistorique et l’étude de deux cas – celui des propriétaires d’œuvres d’art et celui des habitants d’un quartier de la ville d’Esch-sur-Alzette – la thèse remet en question ces idées et ouvre la voie à de nouveaux développements des Holocaust studies sur un territoire jusqu’ici peu étudié.\nBlandine Landau présentera publiquement sa thèse de doctorat le\nmercredi, 17 avril 2024 à 18 heures\nau Mémorial de la Déportation de Hollerich, 3A rue de la Déportation, L-1415 Luxembourg\n17 April 2024\n  Contemporary history of Luxembourg\n  Jewish history  WW2\n  Outreach\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "The Luxembourg steel industry and its main company, ARBED, have undergone a profound transformation since the mid-1970s. Triggered by the economic crisis of 1973, this was characterised by the modernisation and closure of plants, the specialisation of production, international expansion and a far-reaching reduction in the workforce, a process often summarised under the term deindustrialisation. Part of this corporate transformation was the acquisition of the former VEB Maxhütte Unterwellenborn in Thuringia in 1992 and its transformation into a modern and profitable steelworks, making around ninety per cent of the former workers redundant and leading to a delayed but similar process of deindustrialisation. The project examines the history of ARBED between 1973 and 2001, starting from this point of transformation in 1992, and analyses the preconditions and related developments of this takeover, as well as its implications and consequences for ARBED's activities in Thuringia and in Luxembourg. Using a transnational economic history approach, the project aims to analyse the interconnections between processes of deindustrialisation in Western and post-socialist Europe.\n \nWednesday, 17 April 2024\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH Open Space (4th floor, Maison des Sciences humaines)\n17 April 2024\n  Public history\n  Confronting Decline: Challenges of Deindustrialisation in Western Societies since the 1970s\n  Industrial history\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Ce sont autant de façons d’aborder, écrire, analyser, transmettre de nouvelles visions de l’histoire européenne, appuyées sur des sources et formats originaux. Nous vous invitons à les découvrir au cours de ce Forum Z. Élargir l’histoire européenne à de nouveaux publics, raconter l’histoire européenne différemment, c’est aussi, à l’occasion du 20ème anniversaire de l’élargissement de 2004, penser celui-ci autrement, comme y invitera le second temps de cet évènement.\n \nJeudi, 9 mai 2024\n15:30 - 17:00\nMaison Schuman .

          "description": "The conference aims to critically (re)assess the value(s) of the Digital for the field of Jewish Studies as it has been developed and discussed over the past ten years.\nIncluding all phases of research and dissemination from collecting and exploring to constructing and communicating, we will discuss the benefits and pitfalls of the Digital in general and for the field of Jewish Studies in particular. This can be done both from a retrospective—what has worked well and which promises have and have not yet been fulfilled—and from a forward-looking perspective—highlighting directions that might be worth pursuing. In doing so, we take up the recent critical turn in DH and apply it to the field of Jewish Studies. The event includes a hands-on-hackathon.\nThe full program can be consulted here. \nThe conference and Hackathon is generously supported by the European Association for Jewish Studies (EAJS) Conference Grant Programme in European Jewish Studies.\nPlease register by 31 March 2024 at: https://forms.gle/7RE5yNmdESQddofx7\nPlease note that registration for the conference and the hackathon will take place separately.

          "description": "What was the geography of newspaper texts' circulation in the nineteenth-century United States? Scholars understand that many of the texts—including news, fiction, poetry, information, and more—which circulated through the newspaper exchange system originated in urban publication centers on the east coast, such as New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and that circulation often followed postal routes, train lines, or (eventually) telegraph wires. But the more granular dynamics of circulation have proven much harder to trace within massive newspaper archives, particularly the movement of texts among smaller urban and rural areas. Even less clear have been the ways that regional texts circulated from their places of origin back toward the metropole. Drawing on aggregated reprinting data from t…",

The talk will begin with an examination of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (PLC) historical past. It will then introduce a framework of multiple heritage discourses that shape the collective memory of the PLC in 21st-century Poland. The framework explains the diversity of mental models used for worldbuilding and narrative design in Polish heritage narratives. All this leads to a demonstration of how these elements manifest in PLC-based game settings.\nMichał Mochocki (PhD in Literature, Dr. habil. in Culture Studies), serves as the Executive Editor of the European Historical Game Studies journal, and works as an Associate Professor at Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz, Poland. His primary research interest is historical role-playing games, which he examines from the angles of transmedia narratology and heritage studies.

Whilst there has been exponential growth in the number of resources, tools, and methodological discussions in the digital humanities, there remains limited contribution towards traditional historical narratives implementing these, increasing the apparent gap between DH and traditional history. Terminology in the digital humanities – networks, mapping, modelling – has long been used metaphorically to explore historical phenomenon; yet in digitalizing t…",

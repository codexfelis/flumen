In the midst of this fluid situation, it is impossible to choose the hybrid meeting as it was envisioned.\nIn light of this situation, the LOs decided to change the DH2022 to be held entirely online, giving priority to providing equal and safe opportunities for all those who wish to participate. By providing a safe, respectful, and principled environment online for participants from around the world, regardless of the differences in their circumstances, we hope to contribute to the realization of ADHO's principles.\nThe details of the online meeting plan will be expanded from the online meeting portion of the current plan to the full plan. We will do our best to accommodate ADHO members from all over the world in the program and other aspects of the conference.\nFor more information\n\n\nPost Date: \n\nMonday, December 20, 2021",

It begins with an overview of the history of Italian immigration to Toronto and key neighbourhoods built and transformed by this diaspora, including the establishment of landmark food businesses that persist to this day. Using a sociocultural, historical lens, the project further highlights the impact and contributions of the Italian community on Toronto’s food industry, tracing the growth and enduring legacies of restaurants in the face of cultural demographic shifts towards the turn of the century. This project further outlines the importance of recognizing and preserving the culinary traditions of diasporas, particularly in times of crises that impact local businesses and threaten to erase the cultural footprint of immigrant communities.",

This includes: connecting the resources and establishing standardized access to them, providing training environments and consolidating research networks, promoting the theoretical considerations for computational work on literature.\nWith this survey, CLS INFRA is looking for your help to find out which areas of research you would like to see represented in learning the computational and research skills necessary for data-driven studies of literature. Everyone with interest in the subject is invited to partake in the survey, regardless of experience level. The survey takes about 10-15 minutes to complete and you will help us shape the future of computational literary studies! \nThe results of this survey will be used to supplement the current offer in training and schooling: CLS INFRA is organizing a series of Training Schools in the directions outlined by the research community.\nTake me to the survey.\nThanks in advance for your time – and for forwarding the survey to those who might be interested!\nBest wishes on behalf of the CLS INFRA project team,\nWeb\nTwitter\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

Ask away, and @enrique.manjavacas and @l.fonteyn will try to help you as much as we can.\nMore information on the project can be found on our website:\nhttps://macberth.netlify.app/\nMacBERTh is the cover term for a suite of language models (more specifically, BERT models) pre-trained on historical textual material (date range: 1450-1950).\nResearchers who interpret and analyse historical textual material are well-aware that languages are subject to change over time, and that the way in which concepts and discourses of class, gender, norms and prestige function in different time periods. As such, it is quite important that the interpretation of textual/linguistic material from the past is not approached from a present-day point-of-view, which is why NLP models pre-trained on present-day language data are less than ideal candidates for the job. That’s where MacBERTh can help.\nAt present, a model pre-trained on historical English (1450-1950) has been published in the huggingface repository. The release of a Dutch historical model is planned for 2022.\nFor publications and talks related to the project, as well as information on how to cite us, please check our website. If you end up using our model for you research, we would love to highlight and refer others to your work on our website as well, so please do not hesitate to contact us to share your work.\n2 posts - 2 participants\nRead full topic",

At the same time, working groups such as the CEI have been considering the possibilities of a standard to encode medieval and early modern charters in XML, inserting diplomatics’ concepts and charter-specific markup into the framework of the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines.

We are looking for participants to join us in a day of making, research and reflection with the physical materials that underpin AI systems. Those that are conventionally considered to ‘make’ AI through the design of AI systems are largely divorced from AI’s materiality and the craft of making AI. We hope to push participants beyond the theoretical knowing of AI materiality to tactile knowing through a practice-based approach to ‘making’ AI. Reorienting the focus of AI to materials and the supply chain as sites of creative intervention could leverage the potential of sensory, tactile experiences to spur re-imaginations of AI technologies and infrastructures.\nhttps://aiyesterday.com/ACM-C-C-Workshop\n \nProject Team: Margaret McGrath, Nancy Salem, Laurel Boxall\nFunders: TORCH-Minderoo Fund in AI Governance",

During the COVID-19-lockdowns, the digital presence of museums was no longer merely one possible extension of exhibition spaces, but rather the only way to reach the public. While our conference in 2021 focused on the crisis-related (re)turn to one’s own collections, this time it shifts to questions beyond binary concepts, such as media specificity, hybridity, and mixed reality. In five thematic blocks, the lectures deal with how the digital and the analog can be productively, conceptually, and aesthetically interwoven in a museum setting. We are delighted that Max Hollein, the director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, is our keynote speaker.\n \nRegistration, the program, and other information can be found on the conference website: https://www.belvedere.at/en/digitalmuseum2022.",

          "description": "In common with many technical aspects of digital humanities, the TEI has a reputation for being difficult to teach and difficult to learn, with potential practitioners put off by the large and (at first sight) intimidating set of guidelines, the seemingly complex hierarchical structure and the profusion of angle brackets. One-to-one or small group teaching in the context of a specific project is often the preferred method, where the short but steep learning curve required to engage with the TEI can be addressed in a way which is relevant to the aims and experience of the learner. This, however, is not a particularly efficient way of teaching. In this article, the authors discuss their experience of teaching (and learning) the TEI, and how lessons learned in contexts relating to specific projects might feed into the teaching of TEI in a more general setting – the Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School being the prime example.\n Published on 2022-05-24 13:09:19",

          "description": "This paper pioneers a new computational approach for the study of changes in shape of objects across time. Previously, such a study was undertaken by scholars using a purely visual approach and relied on images of objects or in-person observations. This paper’s approach is based on 3D scans of historical artefacts. Sample points are extracted from these 3D scans and the distance between analogous points across different objects is computed using an approximation of the Wasserstein metric, namely the Sinkhorn distance. In this paper, the approach is demonstrated on a small set of ancient Greek vessels of the Krater, Pelike, and Kylix types, as the variation in their shapes across time is well known to archaeologists. Results offer, for the first time, a way of quantifying differences between objects. Benefits of this approach lie in its ability to quantify change, to study complex 3D material, and to analyse large datasets of objects, opening the possibility of constructing new large-scale studies of object shape across time and geographical regions. These have a range of applications in art history, archaeology, digital humanities, museology and extended reality studies.\n Published on 2022-05-20 12:09:58",

It is comprised of complete data management documentation and ethics documentation in English and French, concept notes in English and French, and participant data files that include .csv metadata sheets, .wav audio recordings of interviews, .jpeg photographs of the place of the interview and open ELAN .eaf transcriptions. The participant interview data relies on a narrative inquiry methodology and is collected in one-on-one interviews with researchers on the theme of anglophone expatriation and adaptation to French socio-physical space. These interviews are informal and interactive, aiming for a sharing of experience, since the researchers are, themselves, anglophone expatriates. The aim of this accompanying article is to provide information on the dataset through a concomitant reflection on the research context in France and the affordances of the increasingly powerful TGIR Huma-Num digital humanities infrastructure, as well as the tensions that are prevalent in the Franco-European space between the demands of Open Science and the restrictions of the European General Data Protection Regulations.

          "description": "Using the reparation movement for Japanese colonial and wartime atrocities as a case study, this paper explores the applicability of graph database management systems to network analysis research and teaching in the field of digital humanities. Since the late 1980s, Asian victims of Japanese colonial and wartime atrocities (such as the infamous “comfort women” system) began to sue the Japanese government and corporations with the help of local and Japanese lawyers and activists. This paper uses the plethora of publicly available court materials produced by the movement to study social networks in this transnational historical justice movement and illustrate how graph database management systems can upgrade traditional network analysis methodologies in digital humanities. By inputting the data about lawsuits and lawyers in the movement into graph database applications like Neo4j and GraphXR, the paper demonstrates the advantages of managing network data in graph database structure in terms of scalability, modifiability, intuitive visibility, query efficiency, and analysis potential over relational database structure, which is the mainstream in network analysis research.\n Published on 2022-04-25 13:37:52",

          "description": "While digital archiving has long been standard for linguistics, archives themselves are heterogeneous (Aznar & Seifart 2020), and archived linguistic material is important for researchers and communities, particularly for language reclamation (cf. Baldwin & Olds 2007; Whalen et al. 2016; Hinton 2003, 2018; Kung et al. 2020). The format and usability of scholarly archival collections is shaped by the functions of the management practices at the stewarding institution, making an appreciation of the range of access services provided by such institutions relevant to the evaluation of individual collections.\nHere we report on a review of 41 digital language archives. Three factors are examined: 1) accessibility, including metadata and site navigation; 2) discoverability, or searchability and internal navigation; and 3) functionality, the overall ease of data retrieval and use. We recognize that the decisions made by both stewards and depositors can greatly impact the accessibility of archived materials; to that end, we present recommendations for how archives might increase the utility of their holdings for their users. We emphasize that our intention is not to dissuade linguists from using archives because of these issues, and we recognize the tremendous amount of work that goes into the upkeep of digital infrastructure, often with very limited institutional support. Implementing such recommendations at an institutional level can establish a fairer peer-review process of archival collections. By delineating precisely what standards fall under the archive management level and what procedures individual depositors are responsible for, the roles of “archivist” and “depositor” become clearer.\n Published on 2022-03-24 11:09:26",

We have created a Chinese–English parallel dataset in the domain of finance technology, using the Financial Times website, from which we grabbed 60,473 news items from between 2007 and 2021. This dataset is a bilingual Chinese–English parallel dataset of news in the domain of finance. It is open access in its original state without transformation, and has been made not for machine translation as has been used, but for intelligent mining, in which we conducted many experiments using up-to-date text mining techniques: clustering (topic modeling, community detection, k-means), topic prediction (naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM, Bert), and pattern discovery (dictionary based, time series).

The undirected network of individuals connected by co-occurrences in cuneiform documents was semi-automatically extracted from the Prosopography of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. In addition to two weighted versions of the one-mode co-occurrence network, the dataset also contains a two-mode person-text network and rich metadata for each individual. For the first time, the dataset allows large-scale computational analysis of social structures in the Assyrian Empire. The data is primarily stored as plain text and CSV files, inviting scholars to further expand and enrich it. The scripts and files used for creating and standardizing the data are also available in the Zenodo repository.\n Published on 2022-03-17 13:07:23",

In addition to focusing on the “page’’ as the basic bibliographic unit, our work employs a single predictive model for the historical period under consideration in contrast to prior work. Besides publication metadata, we also provide an enriched feature set of 107 features including part-of-speech tags, sentiment scores, word supersenses and more. Our data is designed to give researchers in the digital humanities large yet portable random samples of historical writing across two foundational modes of English prose writing. We present initial insights into transformations of linguistic patterns across this historical period using our enriched features as possible pointers to future work.

All transcriptions are created and reviewed by volunteers in a consensus-based model in which two or more volunteers must agree on a transcription for it to be considered complete. Resulting transcriptions are added to the digital collections alongside the images to enable search and accessibility of the collections. Additionally, completed transcription “campaigns” are published as freely downloadable datasets of .CSV files containing all campaign transcriptions, as well as minimal metadata.

It consists of 343 annotated articles from newspapers based in four different locations in England (Manchester, Ashton-under-Lyne, Poole and Dorchester), published between 1780 and 1870. The articles have been manually annotated with mentions of places, which are linked—whenever possible—to their corresponding entry on Wikipedia. The dataset consists of 3,364 annotated toponyms, of which 2,784 have been provided with a link to Wikipedia.

          "description": "In this paper, we present the diachronic maps of a selection of 75 Latin modal markers designed through the tool Pygmalion. Both the maps and Pygmalion were conceived in the framework of the WoPoss project, which aims at analysing the diachronic pathways of modality in Latin. While the description of the tool and its functionalities is beyond the scope of this paper, we focus here on the description of our diachronic modal maps.\nUsing visualisations to represent semantic shifts is a well-known practice in some linguistic fields such as typology and lexicography, and they have already been applied to modality. Though the situation is rapidly evolving, typological semantic maps as well as lexicographic maps are still for the most part static and usually not-interactive visualisations. Our modal maps stand out not only for their interactivity, but also for the richness of the information conveyed: chronology, etymology, semantics, syntax, first attestation and diachronic relationships between the meanings.\nAfter presenting our conceptual framework for modality, we illustrate the process of conceptualisation and development of our diachronic maps of modality. More specifically, we explain how we gathered and organised the data in order to transpose it into a visual representation. We then showcase the map of possum as an example of our results. Subsequently, we discuss the results with respect to previous literature concerning both visualisation of modal evolution from a general point of view and the investigation of modality in Latin. Finally, we outline possible applications within and beyond the WoPoss project.\n Published on 2022-01-12 11:37:41",

As an extremely low-resource language with rich inflection and frequent homographs, Old Catalan poses non-trivial problems in the development of a searchable constituency-based treebank. We demonstrate, however, that a semi- supervised method of incrementally building training data using both neural and memory-based taggers, together with the Pyrrha annotation tool is highly efficient and yields accurate results. We propose that this simple and effective method could easily be extended to other low-resource historical languages for which no NLP tools exist yet.\n Published on 2021-12-21 11:08:40",

In this context, the dominant discourses have been generated in the Global North, overwhelmingly by a minority of wealthy and powerful authors, reflecting narrowly on a crisis that, while impacting the whole world, is experienced in vastly different ways. This article frames and contextualises data from this project through an introduction to the background, contexts, and methods of a project designed to reflect the lived experiences of, perspectives on, and responses to COVID-19 in vulnerable communities across sub-Saharan Africa. The project has been carried out by a large team of collaborators who prioritise the lived experiences, customs, and needs of the communities engaged through a culturally responsive and arts-based research approach. The article points to the methodological implications of arts-based research to explore plural perspectives in participatory ways, and the socio-political possibilities of amplifying the voices of under-represented and under-served communities in Africa, in terms of global health in a pandemic context.\n Published on 2021-11-30 11:03:37",

          "description": "Introduction: Open Refine, the freely accessible successor to Google Refine, is an ideal tool for cleaning up data series and thus obtaining more sustainable results. Entries can be searched in alphabetical order or sorted by frequency, so that typing errors or slightly different variants can be easily found and adjusted. For example, with the help of the software, I discovered two such discrepancies in my Augustinian Correspondence Database, which I am now able to correct with one click in the programme. I was shown that I had noted \"As a reference to Jerome's letter it's not counted\" five times and \"As a reference to Jerome's letter, it's not counted\" three times. Consequently, if I searched the database for this expression, I would not see all the results. A second discrepancy was between the entry \"continuing reference (marked by Nam)\" and the entry \"continuing reference (marked by nam)\". Thanks to Open Refine, such errors can be completely avoided in the future.\n\nThe tutorial by Miriam Posner is a useful introduction to come in touch with the software. However, the first step of the installation is already out of date. While version 3.1 was still the latest when the tutorial was published, it is now version 3.5.2. Under Windows, you can now distinguish between a version that requires Java and a version with embedded OpenJDK Java, which I found very pleasing.\n\nIf needed, there are links at the end of the tutorial to other introductions that go into more depth.",

His dissertation examines the mukhaḍramūn—a generation of poets who lived between the pre-Islamic and Islamic era—focusing on the network of emotions surrounding the poetic experience of existing in the threshold of transition, known as khaḍramah. Drawing from theories of affect and emotion, he departs from a historical study of the mukhaḍramūn to develop a theory of khaḍramah that examines how this experience, vis-a-vis biography and anecdote, informs transformations in poetic forms indigenous to the Arabic language. Using optical character recognition and text analysis software, Rawad is compiling a digital archive of poetry collections central to his research to facilitate analysis of linguistic, stylistic, and formal patterns to explore new methods of close and distant reading. Rawad earned two MA degrees in Arabic from the University of Texas at Austin (2017) and the University of California, Los Angeles (2013). He was awarded a fellowship for the Center of Arabic Study Abroad (2014) in Amman, Jordan. Rawad received a Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship Dissertation Abroad Request (2021), Janet Lee Stevens Award in Arabic and Islamic Studies (2020) and was named a Mellon Graduate Fellow (2019).

The proxy app then redirects you to the Trove API Console so you can see the results of the API query without needing a key.\nTo make it easy to use, I created a bookmarklet that encodes your current url and feeds it to the proxy. To use it just:\nDrag this link to your bookmarks toolbar: Open Trove API Console.\nRun a search in Trove’s newspapers.\nClick on the bookmarklet.\nThis little hack provides a bit of ‘glue’ to help researchers think their about search results as data, and explore other possibilities for download and analysis. #dhhacks",

In particular I’ve been pulling together harvests of the number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state. My first harvests date all the way back to 2011, before there was even a Trove API. Unfortunately, I didn’t run the harvests as often as I should’ve and there are some big gaps. Nonetheless, if you’re interested in how Trove’s newspaper corpus has grown and changed over time, you might find them useful. They’re available in this repository and also in Zenodo.\n\nThis chart shows how the number of newspaper articles per year in Trove has changed from 2011 to 2022. Note the rapid growth between 2011 and 2015.\nTo try and make sure that there’s a more consistent record from now on, I’ve also created a new Git Scraper – a GitHub repository that automatically harvests and saves data at weekly intervals. As well as the number of articles by year and state, it also harvests the number of articles by newspaper and category. As mentioned, these four datasets are updated weekly. If you want to get all the changes over time, you can retrieve earlier versions from the repository’s commit history.\nAll the datasets are CC-0 licensed and validated with Frictionless.\nThere’s also a notebook in the GLAM Workbench that explores this sort of data.",

As I’ve previously noted, reports from the ARDC and Academy of Humanities are now publicly available. There was a third document identified as relevant to my request that was finally released yesterday, but it isn’t what I was expecting. It’s a report of consultation relating to a discussion paper by Dandalo Partners, rather than the actual discussion paper itself! Clearly I spoke the wrong magic words, and should have asked for ‘discussion papers’ as well as ‘scoping studies’. FOI can be a bit of a fishing expedition. I’m considering whether I want to start the whole FOI process again by asking for the final version of the discussion paper, but in the meantime, I’ve put the currently-available documents in a Dropbox folder.

These sort of things ease the maintenance burden on me and help make the GLAM Workbench sustainable, even as it continues to grow. But these changes are also aimed at making it easier for you to contribute to the GLAM Workbench!\nPerhaps you’re part of a GLAM organisation that wants to help researchers explore its collection data – why not create your own section of the GLAM Workbench? It would be a great opportunity for staff to develop their own digital skills and learn about the possibilities of Jupyter notebooks. I’ve developed a repository template and some detailed documentation to get you started. The repository template includes everything you need to create and test notebooks, as well as built-in integration with Binder, Docker, Reclaim Cloud, and Zenodo. And, of course, I’ll be around to help you through the process.\n\nOr perhaps you’re a researcher who wants to share some code you’ve developed that extends or improves an existing GLAM Workbench repository. Yes please!  Or maybe you’re a GLAM Workbench user who has something to add to one of the lists of resources; or you’ve noticed a problem with some of the documentation that you’d like to fix. All contributions welcome!\nThe Get involved! page includes links to all this information, as well as some other possibilities such as becoming a sponsor, or sharing news. And to recognise those who make a contribution to the code or documentation there’s also a brand new contributors page.\nI’m looking forward to exploring how we can build the GLAM Workbench together. #dhhacks",

The basic test is, can Zotero capture useful, structured information about an item from the collection interface. The results are not great.\nZotero extracts information from a web site using a variety of 'translators'. Some of these translators look for generic information embedded in a web page, such as <TITLE> and <META> tags. Others are written to work with widely-used software systems, such as library catalogues. For bespoke systems, custom translators can be created to extract the necessary data. But sometimes, the data just isn't available in a form Zotero can access.\ncustom translator for it many years ago. There's also a custom translator for Trove's digitised newspapers, but the translator for other parts of Trove was broken by the site's upgrade in 2020. \n  \nDublin Core metadata in web pages, and Australian government agencies were expected to make use of AGLS to aid web discovery. But it seems these are no longer priorities.\n  \nThe good news is we can fix this, either by supporting and encouraging GLAM organisations to embed useful metadata, or by creating custom translators. There's been a lot of talk about HASS research infrastructure over the last six months, and it seems to me that some integration and cooperation in this area would make a big difference to the way researchers work with GLAM collections.\nonline form available if you'd like to contribute new results to the spreadsheet, or update existing details.",

Part of the problem is that once I've updated the packages, I have to run all the notebooks to make sure I haven't inadvertently broken something -- and this takes time. And in those cases where the notebooks need an API key to run, I have to copy and paste the key in at the appropriate spots, then remember to delete them afterwords. They're little niggles, but they add up, particularly as the GLAM Workbench itself expands.\nI've been looking around at Jupyter notebook automated testing options for a while.

Tools like QueryPic can run as simple web apps using Voila, static versions of notebooks can be viewed using NBViewer, and live versions can be spun up as required on Binder. It’s also possible to export notebooks at PDFs, slideshows, or just plain-old HTML pages. Just recently I realised I could export notebooks to HTML using the same template I use for Voila. This gives me another way of sharing – static web pages delivered via the main GLAM Workbench site.\nHere’s a couple of examples:\nPapers Past newspapers in DigitalNZ – showing which Papers Past newspapers are available through DigitalNZ\nTrove newspapers – number of issues per day, 1803–2020 – the number of newspaper issues published every day in Trove\n\nBoth are HTML pages that embed visualisations created using Altair. The visualisations are rendered using javascript, and even though the notebook isn’t running in a live computing environment, there’s some basic interactivity built-in – for example, you can hover for more details, and click on the DigitalNZ chart to search for articles from a newspaper.

Things like:\nSetting up GitHub actions to automatically generate Docker images when the repositories change, and to upload the images to the Quay.io container registry\nAutomatic generation of an index.ipynb file based on README.md to act as a front page within Jupyter Lab\nAddition of a reclaim-manifest.jps file to allow for one-click installation of the repository in Reclaim Cloud\nAdditional documentation in README.md with instructions on how to run the repository via Binder, Reclaim Cloud, Nectar Research Cloud, and Docker Desktop.\nAddition of a .zenodo.json metadata file so that new releases are preserved in Zenodo\nSwitch to using pip-tools for generating requirements.txt files, and the include unpinned requirements in requirements.in\nUpdate of all Python packages\nFrom the user’s point of view, the main benefit of these changes is the ability to run the repositories in a variety of different environments depending on your needs and skills. The Docker images, generated using repo2Docker, are used by Binder, Reclaim Cloud, Nectar, and Docker Desktop. Same image, multiple environments! See ‘Run these notebooks’ in the DigitalNZ and Te Papa sections of the GLAM Workbench for more information.\n\nOf course, I’ve also re-run all of the notebooks to make sure everything works and to update any statistics, visualisations, and datasets. As a bonus, there’s a couple of new notebooks in the DigitalNZ repository:\nQueryPic DigitalNZ – a web app to visualise searches in Papers Past over time (I’ll post some further info about this shortly)\nPapers Past newspapers in DigitalNZ – displays details of the Papers Past newspapers available through DigitalNZ (you can view the results as an HTML page)\n#dhhacks",

The geographical scope ranges from the industrial regions of Western Europe in Portugal, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Great Britain to the far north of Norway and Central and Eastern Europe (former GDR and Poland). The comparative long-term perspective will shed light on the different conditions of regional development and the cycles of boom and bust in the European context. The focus will be on four main topics: the housing situation of workers and their families, the decline of mining regions, the socio-political resistance of industrial workers, and the journalistic and visual representat…",

          "description": "The virtual exhibition Minett Stories deals with the history and identity of Minett, the industrial region in southern Luxembourg, in 22 chapters. For a century (approx. 1870-1970) the Minett was shaped by iron ore mining and the iron and steel industry. Rapid economic and population growth, urbanisation and labor migration have had a major impact on the history of the region, as have economic crises, environmental pollution and precarious housing and living conditions.\nRemixing Industrial Pasts in the Digital Age is a project of the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH ), launched in fall 2019 and funded by the European Capital of Culture Esch2022 asbl.\nThe \"Minett Stories\" virtual exhibition was developed in collaboration between the Remix team, Milan-based design studio Calibro and Bergamo-based software company Inmagik. The Remix team spent two and a half years researching and sourcing the underlying sources, designing the exhibition, and writing all the storyboards, scripts, story texts, and captions for the 22 exhibition chapters. The focus was on various forms of transmedia storytelling, including several interactive video documentaries, graphic novels, interactive maps, interactive podcasts, and two radio plays. The virtual exhibition will officially open on 28 May 2022.\n \nSaturday, 28 May 2022\n10.30 - 13.30\nSalle Ellipse, Luxembourg Learning Centre\n7, Ënnert den Héichiewen\nL-4362 Esch-Belval\nPlease confirm your participation before 23 May 2022 at vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu.\n \n \n28 May 2022\n  Public history\n  Remixing Industrial Pasts in the Digital Age: Sounds, Images, Ecologies, Practices and Materialities in Space and Time\n  Public History  Regional history\n  Outreach\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "Based on a collection of local and national archival sources, police reports, and press articles, this talk will explore how rock’n’roll and pop music were received in France in the 1960s and the 1970s. Although some ‘threats,’ such as violence and loose moral at rock’n’roll concerts, were present in other countries as well, this talk shows that other so-called hazards should be read in the light of the French context. This was marked by the shadow of the dark years of the Vichy regime, the end of the Algerian war, students’ protests in May 1968, and the lasting influence of the left-wing revolutionary spirit.\nFlorence Tamagne is associate professor in contemporary history at the University of Lille. She has notably published Histoire de l’homosexualité en Europe, Berlin, Londres, Paris (1919-1939) (Seuil, 2000), Mauvais Genre ? Une histoire des représentations de l’homosexualité (La Martinière, 2001) and Le crime du Palace.

          "description": "The “Liewen am Minett” project came to life by an initiative of the Minister of Culture Robert Krieps in 1986. In the photo book’s foreword he stated that the heart of Luxembourg’s industry, “the cradle of its prosperity and the material support of national independence” – the Minett – has been unfairly overlooked, and its “new type of man” – the Minettsdäpp – largely unseen. “It is therefore a kind of injustice,” Krieps continued, “that we want to redress by doing justice to a world which, over the past ten years, has experienced deep anguish and new transformations. We present a snapshot of a part of our country whose rich facets are unknown.” The photo book, curated by Jean Back, exhibited photos of 16 amateur and professional photographers. “Liewen am Minett” was arguably the first soc…",

Jahrhundert diskutiert man, ob Autokraten dieser besonderen Krankheit anheimfallen. Das Konzept, das in der unkontrollierten Alleinherrschaft die Gefahr zu einer psychischen Deformation sah, verbindet historische Erklärungen mit einem medizinischen Ansatz.

          "description": "This presentation will consider the limits of search for exploring digital cultural heritage and discuss some of the alternative modes of discovery that become possible through data linking and visualisation. It will draw on the experience of two projects: the Heritage Connector and the Congruence Engine. Both are concerned with unlocking the full potential of museum catalogues, which are largely unstructured, variable in consistency and overwhelmingly composed of what might be described as ‘thin’ records. The Heritage Connector project sought to build links at scale between the collections of the UK’s Science Museum Group, the Victoria and Albert Museum and Wikidata, and the Congruence Engine initiative expands this work to include data from more than 20 cultural heritage and university partners. New forms of visualisation and access are at the heart of these interdisciplinary collaborations. The presentation will conclude by considering how useful these methods might be for exploring vast born-digital collections, such as web and social media archives.\n \n\n\n \nJane Winters is Chair of Digital Humanities and Pro-Dean for Libraries at the School of Advanced Study, University of London.

          "description": "The history of psychiatry is a history of the difference between normality and madness. However, this difference is becoming increasingly fragile. On the one hand, with the unlocking of psychiatric institutions and the social integration of inmates, madness is becoming everyday normality; on the other hand, behavioural and reaction patterns such as rush, stress or attention deficit are pathologised. Thus, established historiographies, based on the traditional dichotomy, loose purchase on this phenomenon. This is the ground assumption of our project: it takes the erosion of the difference between normal and pathological as the central development in dealing with psychic alterity. This phenomenon lacks adequate historical consideration. Our aim is to historicize the interdependent relationship between the history of psychiatry and historiography, and thus to turn it into an instrument of analysis of the perceived erosion.\n \nWednesday, 20 April 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nHybrid event: C²DH Open Space and online\nIf you want to participate online, please send an e-mail to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link or participate in person by simply coming to the C²DH.\n\n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/logo_research_seminars_content_list.png?itok=r2xDOs_L\n  Research seminar with Benoît Majerus and Samuel Dal Zilio.\n  20 April 2022\n  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Normal#Verrückt.

The exhibition is part of the European Capital of Culture Esch2022 programme. It has been curated by the C²DH REMIX team in collaboration with the Milan-based artist collective Tokonoma and 2F Architettura.\nVisitors will travel through the region’s industrial past in a time machine whose audiovisual narrative unfolds around three main themes: industry, people and landscapes. Using analogue slide projections and audio collages, a remix of fragmented stories is presented throughout the exhibition hall: the violent erasure of natural landscapes by industrial sites; the relentless growth and transformation of indust…",

Thinking through questions of materiality, memory and collecting, the lecture will consider especially those collections held in British military museums arising through colonial wars. The research that informs the lecture comes out of a multi-year research project, combining material anthropology and military history, that seeks to address in particular the material legacies in military museums, as distinct from those in national museums. In recent years the question of colonial collections has regained popular prominence, with a clear association of European collections of the non-European world with the phenomenon of looting, and thus within a wider debate about the legitimacy and legality…",

In this context, the 'FinLux' seminar is held on a monthly basis. It is a place for researchers to discuss ongoing research projects in banking and financial history in a broad sense. The fundamental theme of the seminars is a reflection on which topics, actors, sources, and methods can be used to write the history of the Luxembourg financial centre.\nAll sessions start at 18:00 sharp and will take place virtually at https://unilu.webex.com/meet/benoit.majerus.

          "description": "The project “Ambivalences of Europeanization” aims to reflect on the concept of Europeanization. While ambivalences form a crucial aspect of modernization research, there has been no systematic reflection on the ambivalences of Europeanization. On the basis of numerous case studies, the authors argue that crises, conflicts and contradictory phenomena cannot be regarded as undesirable side effects of an otherwise \"well-intentioned\" and successful Europeanization. Rather, those ambivalences that are evident in colonialism or in the European history of violence are inscribed in the modern concept of Europeanization and accounts for its polyvalence. \nTimm Beichelt is Professor of European Studies at European University Viadrina Frankfurt/Oder and Director of the Viadrina Institute for European Studies; Clara Maddalena Frysztacka is research associate at European University Viadrina Frankfurt/Oder.\n \nTuesday, 22 February 2022 at 5:00PM CET via Webex\nFor the Webex link please contact Adelina Stefan at oana.stefan@uni.lu.\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/cover_ade_1_copy.jpg?itok=z3Eooaj7\n  'Europe Seminar' with Timm Beichelt and Clara Maddalena Frysztacka (European University Viadrina Frankfurt/Oder).\n  22 February 2022\n  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Nation-building\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Much of this debate has focused on the kinds of social biases they encode and the need for humans to correct or intervene in their automated decisions. Humanistic disciplines naturally have much to offer these debates, with their long tradition of attending to the partiality of any claims to generalizable truth. But this critical stance can at times hinder recognition of machine learning as itself mired in a long history of debate over how to reason about error, bias, and the uncertainty of all knowledge. What might humanistic inquiry gain not by thinking around these ideas, as if they were problems belonging to the machine or a…",

          "description": "Data visualization is very often viewed as an equivalent of statistical representation of data in all its forms. This representation serves effectively certain objectives such as abstraction, reduction, standardization, or legibility, of interest to some disciplines and use cases, namely business, engineering, and science. Numerous tools and programming languages allow to visualize data according to these principles. Other disciplines and areas of knowledge, such as history, literature, art, journalism, or education, are confronted with the need to use the same tools ignoring some fundamental principles of their own disciplines, to program from scratch new visual vocabularies and functionalities, or to use design tools that are disconnected from the data.\nAs part of my research, I study the needs of the different disciplines and areas of knowledge, based on their own definitions of data and data visualization, the relationship between the two of them, and the user interaction; but I also experiment with transforming the visualizations from one paradigm to another, so that they can be used in interdisciplinary projects, or to open new approaches to data visualization within the disciplines themselves. During this presentation of my early research, I will present the initial description of the paradigms with a visual gallery of examples. And the first ideas of transformation of the visualizations between paradigms.\n \nWednesday, 19 January 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nOnline - Webex\nIf you want to participate, please send an e-mail to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link.\n19 January 2022\n  Digital history & historiography\n  LuxTime Machine\n  Data Science  Visualisation\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Yet some of the memories aren’t so warm: uncomfortable shoes, the buffet littered with dietary no-nos, some especially cringeworthy circus-themed post-lunch entertainment, and even connectivity problems when I misplaced my adapter! \nBut I also remember my first online conference, the Creative Commons Global Summit in November, 2020. As a conference volunteer, I remember how we scrambled to figure out what was possible: Recording? Networking? Translation?  Dance party? It was a formative and transformative experience. And as transformative as it was for me, it was no doubt even more transformative for people who rarely had access to in-person conferences.\nNow, with over a year of online conferences to learn from, it’s clear the innovations of online conferencing have set guideposts for the future of scholarly communication. Over the past nine months, the FORCE 2021 Organizing Committee  has worked tirelessly to create a conference that draws on the best of what we’ve all learned about global online events. Under the leadership of Osman Aldirdiri, we’ve crafted an event that aspires to be as welcoming as possible to scholarly innovators and communicators from all disciplines, geographies, communities, and career stages.\nWe hope you will join us December 7-9 at FORCE2021: Joining Forces to Advance the Future of Research Communications for an event centering exchange and open discussion. We are members of all of the communities that make up FORCE11--scholars, librarians, archivists, publishers, research funders, and more, broadly and inclusively defined. If you care about the future of research communications and the technologies that are enabling new possibilities, learn more about the conference and REGISTER.\n-Jennifer Miller for the FORCE2021 Organizing Committee",

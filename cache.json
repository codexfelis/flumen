          "description": "The international DH conference has played an eminent role not only in providing a forum for the presentation of completed research results, but also in creating a forum for the exchange of knowledge and research collaboration in the nascent stage of research, and it was therefore judged to be as desirable as possible to hold the meeting face-to-face, even if it involves some difficulties.\nHowever, due to the continuous emergence of new variants, COVID-19 shows no signs of ending, and countries around the world are faced with intermittent and severe restrictions in various aspects, including medical care, education, research, and freedom of travel and movement. In the midst of this fluid situation, it is impossible to choose the hybrid meeting as it was envisioned.\nIn light of this situation, the LOs decided to change the DH2022 to be held entirely online, giving priority to providing equal and safe opportunities for all those who wish to participate. By providing a safe, respectful, and principled environment online for participants from around the world, regardless of the differences in their circumstances, we hope to contribute to the realization of ADHO's principles.\nThe details of the online meeting plan will be expanded from the online meeting portion of the current plan to the full plan. We will do our best to accommodate ADHO members from all over the world in the program and other aspects of the conference.\nFor more information\n\n\nPost Date: \n\nMonday, December 20, 2021",

These fellowships are meant to extend from January through December. However, in late 2020 and early 2021 we developed a communications policy to better support the Communications Team. This work delayed the fellowship call for applications, reviews, and onboarding.\nOur current fellows, Anna Sofia Lippolis and Erdal Ayan began their work with ADHO in June 2021. To ensure that they have the same opportunities as previous fellows who have worked with us most or all of a calendar year—such as completing a special communications project and participating in communications around the Digital Humanities conference—ADHO’s COB have voted to extend their fellowships through December 2022. Anna and Erdal have accepted their extensions, and we are looking forward to working with them over the next year.\nThis means that we will not be accepting Communications Fellowship applications for 2022.

While we met virtually and largely asynchronously for DH2020 instead of gathering as we had so carefully planned in Ottawa, we have greatly missed the sharing of scholarship and fellowship that a 2021 DH conference would have brought. However, we acknowledged early in the year that health and safety restrictions would have made an international DH conference impossible in 2021.

          "description": "Reading can be a solitary activity—an interior conversation between reader and author. Often this conversation unfolds as marginalia. While I typically read with a notebook next to me, much of my thoughts and reactions to what I read are overlayed directly on the text. An underlined phrase, a scribbled connection, a stray exclamation point reflecting the thrill of being surprised (amazing!) or feeling righteously indignant (how dare he!?!). While I’ve experimented with the highlighting and comment features offered by different pdf readers, these have never felt as satisfying as the closeness of scribbling my reflections alongside the text that prompted them. \n\nEarlier in October, I had the pleasure of having my private world of pen and paper marginalia broadened by the concept of social annotation. To learn more about the workshop and for an interview with the facilitator, Arun Jacob, keep reading.",

Through the abstraction of journal elements as data, we seek to produce representations that will make not only the journals’ contents but also big picture structures available to distant reading and analysis for researchers.\nWe ask: What can we ask of periodicals that we might not of other digitized media? What can machine learning tell us about these journals that might be overlooked in ordinary or habitual reading practices? What patterns can we discover across a collection? What types of images or subjects appear and disappear in the history of publication? Are there unexpected points of continuity or difference between a diverse set of journals published at the start of the twentieth century?\nThis Stanford-based extension of the project, begun at Princeton University and in collaboration with ITMO University in St. Petersburg, focuses particularly on the diverse images featured in the journals’ pages. Having begun with the articulation of rudimentary image typologies and applied computer learning to the image corpus (identifying illustrations, photographs, caricature, advertisements as well as subjects), we are currently looking for new ways to extract data related to color values and quantity across the journal runs.\nImage top: Training the model in document segmentation to predict constituent parts of a journal page, from 30 dnei\nImage bottom: Example of a color mask for an image in the journal 30 dnei",

Ask away, and @enrique.manjavacas and @l.fonteyn will try to help you as much as we can.\nMore information on the project can be found on our website:\nhttps://macberth.netlify.app/\nMacBERTh is the cover term for a suite of language models (more specifically, BERT models) pre-trained on historical textual material (date range: 1450-1950).\nResearchers who interpret and analyse historical textual material are well-aware that languages are subject to change over time, and that the way in which concepts and discourses of class, gender, norms and prestige function in different time periods. As such, it is quite important that the interpretation of textual/linguistic material from the past is not approached from a present-day point-of-view, which is why NLP models pre-trained on present-day language data are less than ideal candidates for the job. That’s where MacBERTh can help.\nAt present, a model pre-trained on historical English (1450-1950) has been published in the huggingface repository. The release of a Dutch historical model is planned for 2022.\nFor publications and talks related to the project, as well as information on how to cite us, please check our website. If you end up using our model for you research, we would love to highlight and refer others to your work on our website as well, so please do not hesitate to contact us to share your work.\n2 posts - 2 participants\nRead full topic",

These technologies make it possible to automate labeling tasks that would otherwise be too time-consuming or tedious to perform by hand. However, NLP systems do not achieve perfect accuracy. More concerning, their errors are not uniformly distributed, but rather, can encode and propagate bias from the training data. In this talk, I will survey the validity threats that arise from various types of learning-based NLP systems, ranging from classical models like logistic regression to contemporary architectures that combine pretraining, fine-tuning, and domain adaptation. Of particular interest is the problem of underspecification, highlighted by D’Amour et al (2020): even when overall test set accuracy can be estimated with high precision, the performance on other metrics may vary dramatically with seemingly irrelevant details such as the seed value used to randomly initialize the model’s parameters. After this survey, I will describe our approach to validity in our work on Abolitionist Networks (Soni et al 2021), which combines topic models and network analysis. I will conclude by offering a set of recommendations for practitioners in the digital humanities.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

As a first step towards olfactory information extraction, I will present ongoing work aimed at defining a theoretical framework to capture this information from a linguistic point of view. This framework has led to the development of a multilingual benchmark with annotated smell events, covering different time periods and domains. Based on this novel dataset, it is now possible to make cross-lingual comparisons, pointing out different attitudes and perceptions of good and bad smells. The annotation effort will also inform the development of NLP-based systems for olfactory information processing. Existing challenges of this task and possible solutions will also be discussed in the talk.\n1 post - 1 participant\nRead full topic",

          "description": "When comparing topics between LDA models trained on different collections of text, it’s common for people to use the Jensen-Shannon divergence as a measure of the (dis)similarity between topics. However, this is complicated a bit if the two collections being compared have differences in their vocabularies (i.e., some word types may be present in one collection, but not the other).\nFor example, if collection 1 has vocabulary {a, b, c} and collection 2 has vocabulary {b, c, d}, then comparisons between topics trained on the different collections require a to be inserted into the topics from collection 2, and d to be inserted into the topics learned from collection 1. My guess is that most people just insert such words with probability of 0, but I haven’t been able to find a case where this is actually addressed in the paper.\nI’m trying to think through the implications of how this issue might be handled and am looking for literature that addresses this in any way.

          "description": "And kind of upset. I thought the reviews were rather harsh. They seemed to misunderstand and downplay the humanistic payoff of the paper, instead discounting the piece for not following a (IMO stale) intro-methods-results-conclusion rubric, with heavy citation to related methods, as if I were only developing new tools rather than deriving new historical insights from them. I’m not familiar with this event but I thought this was more computational humanities than computational social science or computer science. What disciplinary backgrounds do the reviewers hail from?\nCongratulations, though, to those accepted, and thanks to the organisers for putting this together. Sorry for being a bit petty: I’ve just been rejected from ADHO a few times now, I think for being a bit too pitched to a computational-heavy audience, and now rejected from CHR, for being a bit too pitched to a humanistic audience, and wondering where my work even belongs anymore.

During the COVID-19-lockdowns, the digital presence of museums was no longer merely one possible extension of exhibition spaces, but rather the only way to reach the public. While our conference in 2021 focused on the crisis-related (re)turn to one’s own collections, this time it shifts to questions beyond binary concepts, such as media specificity, hybridity, and mixed reality. In five thematic blocks, the lectures deal with how the digital and the analog can be productively, conceptually, and aesthetically interwoven in a museum setting. We are delighted that Max Hollein, the director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, is our keynote speaker.\n \nRegistration, the program, and other information can be found on the conference website: https://www.belvedere.at/en/digitalmuseum2022.",

Unfortunately, a significant number of DH’ers coming from areas of knowledge such as literature, philology, history, etc., still experience great difficulties when it comes to use programming languages to handle their data and display it. This meeting aims to address these difficulties and discuss the latest developments associated to programming in DHs by bringing together scientists from different areas within the community.\nFor registration and submission of abstracts, please use the Indico platform, where you will be asked to create a user profile:\nhttps://indico.hpc.uevora.pt/event/8/\n \nThe organising committee,\nSandra Boto \nMiguel A.

          "description": "In this paper, we present the diachronic maps of a selection of 75 Latin modal markers designed through the tool Pygmalion. Both the maps and Pygmalion were conceived in the framework of the WoPoss project, which aims at analysing the diachronic pathways of modality in Latin. While the description of the tool and its functionalities is beyond the scope of this paper, we focus here on the description of our diachronic modal maps.\nUsing visualisations to represent semantic shifts is a well-known practice in some linguistic fields such as typology and lexicography, and they have already been applied to modality. Though the situation is rapidly evolving, typological semantic maps as well as lexicographic maps are still for the most part static and usually not-interactive visualisations. Our modal maps stand out not only for their interactivity, but also for the richness of the information conveyed: chronology, etymology, semantics, syntax, first attestation and diachronic relationships between the meanings.\nAfter presenting our conceptual framework for modality, we illustrate the process of conceptualisation and development of our diachronic maps of modality. More specifically, we explain how we gathered and organised the data in order to transpose it into a visual representation. We then showcase the map of possum as an example of our results. Subsequently, we discuss the results with respect to previous literature concerning both visualisation of modal evolution from a general point of view and the investigation of modality in Latin. Finally, we outline possible applications within and beyond the WoPoss project.\n Published on 2022-01-12 11:37:41",

As an extremely low-resource language with rich inflection and frequent homographs, Old Catalan poses non-trivial problems in the development of a searchable constituency-based treebank. We demonstrate, however, that a semi- supervised method of incrementally building training data using both neural and memory-based taggers, together with the Pyrrha annotation tool is highly efficient and yields accurate results. We propose that this simple and effective method could easily be extended to other low-resource historical languages for which no NLP tools exist yet.\n Published on 2021-12-21 11:08:40",

In this context, the dominant discourses have been generated in the Global North, overwhelmingly by a minority of wealthy and powerful authors, reflecting narrowly on a crisis that, while impacting the whole world, is experienced in vastly different ways. This article frames and contextualises data from this project through an introduction to the background, contexts, and methods of a project designed to reflect the lived experiences of, perspectives on, and responses to COVID-19 in vulnerable communities across sub-Saharan Africa. The project has been carried out by a large team of collaborators who prioritise the lived experiences, customs, and needs of the communities engaged through a culturally responsive and arts-based research approach. The article points to the methodological implications of arts-based research to explore plural perspectives in participatory ways, and the socio-political possibilities of amplifying the voices of under-represented and under-served communities in Africa, in terms of global health in a pandemic context.\n Published on 2021-11-30 11:03:37",

          "description": "Existing text recognition engines enables to train general models to recognize not only one specific hand but a multitude of historical hands within a particular script, and from a rather large time period (more than 100 years). This paper compares different text recognition engines and their performance on a test set independent of the training and validation sets. We argue that both, test set and ground truth, should be made available by researchers as part of a shared task to allow for the comparison of engines. This will give insight into the range of possible options for institutions in need of recognition models. As a test set, we provide a data set consisting of 2,426 lines which have been randomly selected from meeting minutes of the Swiss Federal Council from 1848 to 1903. To our knowledge, neither the aforementioned text lines, which we take as ground truth, nor the multitude of different hands within this corpus have ever been used to train handwritten text recognition models. In addition, the data set used is perfect for making comparisons involving recognition engines and large training sets due to its variability and the time frame it spans. Consequently, this paper argues that both the tested engines, HTR+ and PyLaia, can handle large training sets. The resulting models have yielded very good results on a test set consisting of unknown but stylistically similar hands.\n Published on 2021-07-09 10:49:34",

Consequently, the authors argue that this method constitutes a transferable and scalable practice that can be used by other representative institutions for the creation and subsequent study of their open data.\n Published on 2021-08-04 11:00:17",

          "description": "In this paper, we discuss how different types of automatic annotation of digitised newspaper articles can be integrated into the iterative questioning of the source material and the creation of research corpora out of a collection of unstructured texts (kept in a structured collection). We annotate a sizeable collection of Swiss press articles (183,270), extracted via the impresso interface1 using topic modelling (MALLET)2 as well as a naïve Bayes classifier (script by Milan van Lange).\nThe methodological discussion we propose is to explore how text mining can help identify historical discourses that are difficult to query with keywords because of their inherent ambiguity and how to grasp them in a large corpus. We argue that the automated annotations can provide a body of corroborating evidence of the searched discourse, to be used as an intermediary and heuristic analysis step.\n Published on 2021-09-17 11:39:06",

          "description": "This work presents an enriched version of the Parish Memories (1758–1761), an essential Portuguese historical source manually transcribed. It is enriched with annotations of named entities of the types PERSON, LOCATION, and ORGANIZATION. The annotation was done automatically for the whole collection where two researchers annotated a portion of it manually for evaluation purposes. In this dataset, we provide the tagged texts, the lists of extracted entities, and frequency counts. The corpus is useful for historians, allowing, for instance, comparative analyses between parishes and regions or to calculate the area of influence of a locality. The paper describes the creation and evaluation of the corpus, discusses its applications and limitations. This first release may be improved by other researchers interested in the historical source itself or in the technology employed in its annotation.\n Published on 2021-09-09 11:25:41",

          "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the obvious implications for public health and the economy at a global scale, has also had significant social and cultural effects: the partial or complete lockdown of public life breaks social and cultural networks and habits, and necessitates the invention of new forms of communication, contact, and inspiration. Over the course of the pandemic, various initiatives have emerged that have tried to capture this unique moment in history by collecting documentation on the social and cultural impact of the pandemic on people’s daily lives. Most of these collections were created bottom-up, either by actively approaching individuals or communities to contribute or be interviewed, or by opening platforms where citizens could directly contribute documentation. In this paper, we analyse two such citizen-generated collections of experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic: the ‘Corona in the City’ collection, assembled by the Amsterdam Museum for an online exhibition with the same title, and the ‘Dagboek Corona’ (Corona Diary) collection of diary contributions, assembled by the Dutch public historian and journalist José Boon. The paper discusses the background of these citizen-generated COVID-19 collections, assessing their scope and accessibility, and presenting a first, qualitative analysis of their content. We conclude with a reflection on the implications of the findings for people’s social life and identity, indicating how the datasets can be explored in further research and how the findings may benefit effective policy making.\n Published on 2021-07-21 12:09:35",

(https://melaniewalsh.github.io/BERT-for-Humanists/tutorials/ ). A further advantage of this training resource is that it has been written with sensitivity towards the target audience in mind:  in a way that it provides a gentle introduction to complexities of language models to scholars with education and background other than Computer Science.\n\n\nAlong with the Tutorials, the same blog includes Introductions about BERT in general and in its specific usage in a Google Colab notebook, as well as a constantly-updated bibliography and a glossary of the main terms ('attention', 'Fine-Tune', 'GPU', 'Label', 'Task', 'Transformers', 'Token', 'Type', 'Vector').",

With the idea of determining theses texts’ degree of cohesion, the author follows a computational and quantitative methodology to compare and contrast them, as well as assess their internal contradictions. A normalized corpus, statistics and visualizations are employed so as to evaluate the terminology, topoi and sentimentality of these works.  In relation to terminology, author’s findings revealed that Nietzsche uses a highly differentiated vocabulary from that of the other philosophers, adding marked emotional connotations to his discourse. Visualizations showed the terminological commonalities between Hegel and Schopenhauer and shed light on the former bearing the highest number of semantic connections with the other philosophers.  As for topoi, results showed there is a clear dichotomic tension between conceptual and vital experience in the studied documents. Redefining this dualism, however, Cebral Loureda observed that the concrete is always intertwined with the abstract and vice versa.  Regarding the sentimental dimension of these works, examination unveiled that Nietzsche’s presents the greatest negative sentimental load. In contrast, Spinoza’s is the most emotionally balanced. With all this, Cebral Loureda proves that there is a high degree of cohesion among these philosophical works, which link reason and emotion to will, time and spirit, core notions of modern philosophy and society.",

          "description": "Last year I started compiling information about the level of Zotero integration provided by Australian GLAM organisations though their online collections. The basic test is, can Zotero capture useful, structured information about an item from the collection interface. The results are not great.\nZotero extracts information from a web site using a variety of 'translators'. Some of these translators look for generic information embedded in a web page, such as <TITLE> and <META> tags. Others are written to work with widely-used software systems, such as library catalogues. For bespoke systems, custom translators can be created to extract the necessary data. But sometimes, the data just isn't available in a form Zotero can access.\ncustom translator for it many years ago. There's also a custom translator for Trove's digitised newspapers, but the translator for other parts of Trove was broken by the site's upgrade in 2020. \n  \nDublin Core metadata in web pages, and Australian government agencies were expected to make use of AGLS to aid web discovery. But it seems these are no longer priorities.\n  \nThe good news is we can fix this, either by supporting and encouraging GLAM organisations to embed useful metadata, or by creating custom translators. There's been a lot of talk about HASS research infrastructure over the last six months, and it seems to me that some integration and cooperation in this area would make a big difference to the way researchers work with GLAM collections.\nonline form available if you'd like to contribute new results to the spreadsheet, or update existing details.",

Part of the problem is that once I've updated the packages, I have to run all the notebooks to make sure I haven't inadvertently broken something -- and this takes time. And in those cases where the notebooks need an API key to run, I have to copy and paste the key in at the appropriate spots, then remember to delete them afterwords. They're little niggles, but they add up, particularly as the GLAM Workbench itself expands.\nI've been looking around at Jupyter notebook automated testing options for a while. There's nbmake, testbook, and nbval, as well as custom solutions involving things like papermill and nbconvert. After much wavering, I finally decided to…",

Tools like QueryPic can run as simple web apps using Voila, static versions of notebooks can be viewed using NBViewer, and live versions can be spun up as required on Binder. It’s also possible to export notebooks at PDFs, slideshows, or just plain-old HTML pages. Just recently I realised I could export notebooks to HTML using the same template I use for Voila. This gives me another way of sharing – static web pages delivered via the main GLAM Workbench site.\nHere’s a couple of examples:\nPapers Past newspapers in DigitalNZ – showing which Papers Past newspapers are available through DigitalNZ\nTrove newspapers – number of issues per day, 1803–2020 – the number of newspaper issues published every day in Trove\n\nBoth are HTML pages that embed visualisations created using Altair. The visualisations are rendered using javascript, and even though the notebook isn’t running in a live computing environment, there’s some basic interactivity built-in – for example, you can hover for more details, and click on the DigitalNZ chart to search for articles from a newspaper.

This means you can create your very own version of these repositories running in the Nectar Cloud, simply by choosing them from the app’s dropdown list. See the Using Nectar help page for more information.\n\nI’ve also taken the opportunity to make use of the new container registry service developed by the ARDC as part of the ARCOS project. The app now pulls the GLAM Workbench Docker images from Quay.io via the container registry’s cache. This means that copies of the images are cached locally, speeding things up and saving on data transfers. Yay for integration!\n\nThanks again to Andy and the Nectar Cloud staff for their help! #dhhacks",

          "description": "In preparation for my talk at ResBaz Aotearoa, I updated the DigitalNZ and Te Papa sections of the GLAM Workbench. Most of the changes are related to management, maintenance, and integration of the repositories. Things like:\nSetting up GitHub actions to automatically generate Docker images when the repositories change, and to upload the images to the Quay.io container registry\nAutomatic generation of an index.ipynb file based on README.md to act as a front page within Jupyter Lab\nAddition of a reclaim-manifest.jps file to allow for one-click installation of the repository in Reclaim Cloud\nAdditional documentation in README.md with instructions on how to run the repository via Binder, Reclaim Cloud, Nectar Research Cloud, and Docker Desktop.\nAddition of a .zenodo.json metadata file so that new releases are preserved in Zenodo\nSwitch to using pip-tools for generating requirements.txt files, and the include unpinned requirements in requirements.in\nUpdate of all Python packages\nFrom the user’s point of view, the main benefit of these changes is the ability to run the repositories in a variety of different environments depending on your needs and skills. The Docker images, generated using repo2Docker, are used by Binder, Reclaim Cloud, Nectar, and Docker Desktop. Same image, multiple environments! See ‘Run these notebooks’ in the DigitalNZ and Te Papa sections of the GLAM Workbench for more information.\n\nOf course, I’ve also re-run all of the notebooks to make sure everything works and to update any statistics, visualisations, and datasets. As a bonus, there’s a couple of new notebooks in the DigitalNZ repository:\nQueryPic DigitalNZ – a web app to visualise searches in Papers Past over time (I’ll post some further info about this shortly)\nPapers Past newspapers in DigitalNZ – displays details of the Papers Past newspapers available through DigitalNZ (you can view the results as an HTML page)\n#dhhacks",

          "description": "I’m hoping that the GLAM Workbench will encourage GLAM organisations and GLAM data nerds (like me) to create their own Jupyter notebooks. If they do, they can put a link to them in the list of GLAM Jupyter resources. But what if they want to add the notebooks to the GLAM Workbench itself?\nTo make this easier, I’ve been working on a template repository for the GLAM Workbench. It generates a new skeleton repository with all the files you need to develop and manage your own section of the GLAM Workbench. It uses GitHub’s built in templating feature, together with Cookiecutter , and this GitHub Action by Stefan Buck. Stefan has also written a very helpful blog post.\nThe new repository is configured to do various things automatically, such as generate and save Docker images, and integrate with Reclaim Cloud and Zenodo. Lurking inside the dev folder of each new repository, you’ll find some basic details on how to set up and manage your development environment.\nThis is just the first step. There’s more documentation to come, but you’re very welcome to try it out. And, of course, if you are interested in contributing to the development of the GLAM Workbench, let me know and I’ll help get you set up!",

Rather than submit this plan to the ARDC for consideration as part of the HASS RDC process, the NLA wisely decided to make some fundamental changes. The redrafted draft is now available for re-feedback. This is where we pick up the story…\nSo what has changed?\nGenerally speaking there seem to be two major changes.\nThere’s a much greater focus on consultation and collaboration.\nThere’s less detail about what will actually be developed.\nThese two changes can work together positively. The details of what’s being developed can be worked out through consultation, ensuring that what’s developed meets real research needs.…",

Eight years years later I was back, still spruiking the possibilities of Trove data. This time, however, I was discussing Trove in the broader context of GLAM data – all the exciting possibilities that have emerged as galleries, libraries, archives and museums make more of their collections available in machine-readable form. The big question is, of course, how do researchers, particularly those in the humanities, make use of that data? The GLAM Workbench is my attempt to address that question – to provide humanities researchers with both the tools and information they need, and an understanding of the possibilities that might emerge if they invest a bit of time in working with GLAM data. My eResearch Australasia 2021 presentation provides a quick introduction to the GLAM Workbench, here’s the video, and the slides.\n\n\nA GLAM Workbench for humanities researchers from Tim Sherratt on Vimeo.\n\n\nThe presentation was pre-recorded, but I managed to sneak in an update via chat for those who attended the session.

As part of the harvesting process, I’ve created lists of both that are available in digital form – this includes digitised works, as well as those that are born-digital (such as PDFs or epubs). I’ve published the full lists of books and periodicals as searchable databases to make them easy to explore.\n\nOne thing that you might notice is that works with the format ‘Government publication’ pop up in both lists – sometimes it’s not clear whether something is a ‘book’ or ‘periodical’. To make it easier to find these items, no matter what their format, I’ve combined data from my two harvests and created a searchable dataset of government publications. It includes links to download OCRd text from CloudStor if available.\nAll three databases make use of Datasette, which I’ve also used for the GLAM Name Index Search. One of the cool things about Datasette is that it provides it’s own API, so if you find some interesting in any of these databases, you can easily download the machine-readable data for further analysis. #dhhacks",

          "description": "We’re in the midst of planning for the HASS Research Data Commons, which will deliver some much-needed investment in digital research infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences. Amongst the funded programs are tools for text analysis as part of the Linguistics Data Commons, and a platform for more advanced research using Trove. I’m hoping that this will be an opportunity to take stock of existing tools and resources, and build flexible pathways for researchers that enable them to collect, move, analyse, preserve, and share data across different platforms and services.\nTo this end, I thought it might be useful to try and summarise what the GLAM Workbench offers, particularly for Trove researchers.

          "description": "There’s a lot of rich historical data contained within the indexes that Australian GLAM organisations provide to help people navigate their records. These indexes, often created by volunteers, allow access by key fields such as name, date or location. They aid discovery, but also allow new forms of analysis and visualisation. Kate Bagnall and I wrote about some of the possibilities, and the difficulties, in this recently published article.\nMany of these indexes can be downloaded from government data portals. The GLAM Workbench demonstrates how these can be harvested, and provides a list of available datasets to browse. But what’s inside them? The GLAM CSV Explorer visualises the contents of the indexes to give you a sneak peek and encourage you to dig deeper.\nThere’s even more indexes avai…",

          "description": "The Trove books section of the GLAM Workbench has been updated! There’s freshly-harvested data, as well as updated Python packages, integration with Reclaim Cloud, and automated Docker builds.\nIncluded is a notebook to harvest details of all books available from Trove in digital form. This includes both digitised books, that have been scanned and OCRd, as well as born digital publications, such as PDFs and epubs. The definition of ‘books’ is pretty loose – I’ve harvested details of anything that has been assigned the format ‘Book’ in Trove, but this includes ephemera, such as posters, pamphlets, and advertising.\nIn the latest harvest, I ended up with details of 42,174 ‘books’. This includes some duplicates, because multiple metadata entries can point to the same digital object. I thought it was best to preserve the duplicates, rather than discard the metadata.\nOnce I’d harvested the details of the books, I tried to see if there was any OCRd text available for download. If there was, I saved it to a public folder on CloudStor. In total, I was able to download 26,762 files of OCRd text.\n\nThe easiest way to explore the books is using this searchable database. It’s created using Datasette and is running on Glitch. Full text search is available on the ‘title’ and ‘contributors’ fields, and you can filter on things like date, copyright status, number of pages, and whether OCRd text is available for download. If there is OCRd text, a direct link to the file on CloudStor is included. You can use the database to filter the titles, creating your own dataset that you can download in CSV or JSON format.\nIf you just want the full list of books as a CSV file, you can download it here. And if you want all the OCRd text, you can go straight to the public folder on CloudStor – there’s about 3.6gb of text files to explore! #dhhacks",

But amongst the items catalogued as ‘books’ are a wide assortment of ephemera, posters, advertisements, and other oddities. There’s no consistent way of identifying these items through the search interface, but because I’ve found the number of pages in each ‘book’ as part of the harvesting process, I can limit results to items with just a single digitised page – there’s more than 1,500! To make it easy to explore this collection of odds and ends, I’ve downloaded all the single page images and compiled them into one big PDF with links back to their entries in Trove. Enjoy your browsing!\n\nThis is another example of the ways in which we can extend and enrich existing collection interfaces using simple technologies like PDFs and CSVs. We can create slices across existing categories to expose interesting features, and provide new entry points for researchers. Some other examples in the GLAM Workbench are the collection of editorial cartoons from The Bulletin, the list of Trove newspapers with non-English content, the harvest of ABC Radio National programs, and the recent collection of politicians talking about COVID. Let me know if you have any ideas for additional slices! #dhhacks",

While ambivalences form a crucial aspect of modernization research, there has been no systematic reflection on the ambivalences of Europeanization. On the basis of numerous case studies, the authors argue that crises, conflicts and contradictory phenomena cannot be regarded as undesirable side effects of an otherwise \"well-intentioned\" and successful Europeanization. Rather, those ambivalences that are evident in colonialism or in the European history of violence are inscribed in the modern concept of Europeanization and accounts for its polyvalence. \nTimm Beichelt is Professor of European Studies at European University Viadrina Frankfurt/Oder and Director of the Viadrina Institute for European Studies; Clara Maddalena Frysztacka is research associate at European University Viadrina Frankfurt/Oder.\n \nTuesday, 22 February 2022 at 5:00PM CET via Webex\nFor the Webex link please contact Adelina Stefan at oana.stefan@uni.lu.\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/cover_ade_1_copy.jpg?itok=z3Eooaj7\n  'Europe Seminar' with Timm Beichelt and Clara Maddalena Frysztacka (European University Viadrina Frankfurt/Oder).\n  22 February 2022\n  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Nation-building\n  Conferences\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

Much of this debate has focused on the kinds of social biases they encode and the need for humans to correct or intervene in their automated decisions. Humanistic disciplines naturally have much to offer these debates, with their long tradition of attending to the partiality of any claims to generalizable truth. But this critical stance can at times hinder recognition of machine learning as itself mired in a long history of debate over how to reason about error, bias, and the uncertainty of all knowledge.

          "description": "Data visualization is very often viewed as an equivalent of statistical representation of data in all its forms. This representation serves effectively certain objectives such as abstraction, reduction, standardization, or legibility, of interest to some disciplines and use cases, namely business, engineering, and science. Numerous tools and programming languages allow to visualize data according to these principles. Other disciplines and areas of knowledge, such as history, literature, art, journalism, or education, are confronted with the need to use the same tools ignoring some fundamental principles of their own disciplines, to program from scratch new visual vocabularies and functionalities, or to use design tools that are disconnected from the data.\nAs part of my research, I study the needs of the different disciplines and areas of knowledge, based on their own definitions of data and data visualization, the relationship between the two of them, and the user interaction; but I also experiment with transforming the visualizations from one paradigm to another, so that they can be used in interdisciplinary projects, or to open new approaches to data visualization within the disciplines themselves. During this presentation of my early research, I will present the initial description of the paradigms with a visual gallery of examples. And the first ideas of transformation of the visualizations between paradigms.\n \nWednesday, 19 January 2022\n14.00 - 15.00\nOnline - Webex\nIf you want to participate, please send an e-mail to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link.\n19 January 2022\n  Digital history & historiography\n  LuxTime Machine\n  Data Science  Visualisation\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

          "description": "Du milieu du 19e siècle aux années 1960, des dizaines de milliers d’ouvriers et d’ouvrières belges sont partis chaque année travailler dans le Nord de la France pour y profiter d’opportunités d’emploi plus avantageuses qu’en Belgique. Ils/elles travaillaient dans l’agriculture, l’industrie ou le secteur de la construction et réalisaient les travaux les plus pénibles et les moins bien rémunérés. Ces migrations ouvrières ont été tour à tour freinées ou encouragées, selon le contexte économique et les besoins de main d’œuvre dans le Nord de la France. Elles ont donné lieu à des tensions et des négociations entre les industriels, les syndicats, les associations qui défendaient les intérêts des migrants et les autorités publiques, de part et d’autre de la frontière.

Navigating diverse experiences and perceptions of the past raises the matter of diverse interpretations of historical narratives and their possible inclusion in historiography and museums.

In this talk, I will ask you to participate in our interpretive process and help to name the clusters yourselves (then we can see how your labels line up with the ones that we came up with).

          "description": "Comics are often used in research as a counter-narrative for an Americanisation of European societies in the second half of the 20th century. The Franco-Belgian bande dessinée school meanwhile appears as a symbol of a successful resistance against the American superheroes.\nThis presentation of my thesis research has two primary aims:\non the one hand to portray the history of Franco-Belgian comics diffusion in a (Western) European context,\nbut on the other hand to critically examine the hypothesis of Europeanisation in the 1960s.\nWhile there is interest in the field of translation strategies that have been applied to central works of the Franco-Belgian school, there has been little attention paid to the editorial practices of the 1960s that facilitated this translation. Comics circulate across language barriers, and so allow insights into the relationship between different countries and cultures, the circulation of cultural goods inside and outside the production space, and the role of cultural mediators. Comics are also just one aspect of a transmedial and transnational space of the 1960s, factors that are most clearly indicated by comics magazines such as Journal de Tintin and Pilote, and these examples and their translations will form the main corpus of primary sources. This thesis will therefore consider the lens of publishing practice in order to shed a new light on these crucial aspects.\n \nWednesday, 17 Novvember 2021\n14.00 - 15.00\nC²DH open space and Webex\nIf you want to participate online, please send an email to vanessa.napolitano@uni.lu to receive the link.\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/logo_research_seminars_content_list.png?itok=r2xDOs_L\n  Research seminar with Jessica Burton, PhD candidate at the C²DH.\n  17 November 2021\n  Popkult60\n  Media history\n  Research seminars\n  Published  \n    Hide image in content detail",

It posits that industrialisation provided an aesthetic canvas for literary modernism and illustrates the ways in which the writer and journalist Batty Weber and his contemporaries sought to modernise a dominant ideological attachment to the soil by instituting the sky as the never-fixed embodiment of ideational change. In the arts, industry as a subject was mainly taken up by avant-garde writers, who constructed the industrial light spectacle and billowing smokes as symbols of intellectual progress and supranational cosmopolitan exchange.

          "description": "The reporting on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961 is considered one of the first international media events. At the same time, the trial marked a turning point in society's examination of the Holocaust and was very much in the spirit of the Cold War. The two German states also regularly reported on the trial in various media. These contemporary video clips, audio documents and newspaper articles were researched, compiled and commented on in a two-year project with students of Public History at the FU Berlin. The results are presented in the form of a DVD.\nThe lecture traces the project from the idea to the implementation as a student project and presents the result in the form of the DVD.\n\n\nIrmgard Zündorf is a visiting research scientist at the Luxembourg Centre for Contem…",

          "description": "During the last two decades, scholars have increasingly stressed the importance of culture in the history of European integration. Studies have unpacked the European Union’s attempts to sell the European project to audiences in the Member States and abroad, yet little is known about the role exhibitions played in this process. Developing stands and pavilions for regional, national and international exhibitions formed a significant strategy within the European cultural politics complex. My PhD thesis looks at the participation of the EU in the international exhibitions that hold the largest political and symbolic importance: World Expos.\nIn her thesis Anastasia Remes selects four pavilions as case studies: the European Coal and Steel Community pavilion in Brussels in 1958, the European Communities pavilion in Montreal in 1967, the European Community pavilion in Seville in 1992 and the EU pavilion in Shanghai in 2010. In this presentation, I will discuss how the European pavilions presented the EU at the various World Expos. I will expand on the three research questions that have driven my research: to what extent is the EU presented as a state, how is the EU’s global power constructed and how did the EU transform its message in engaging pavilions and exhibitions?\n \nTuesday, 21 September 2021, starting at 17.00\nOnline\nfor the Webex link please contact Adelina Stefan at oana.stefan@uni.lu\n \n\n  https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/europe_seminar_remes21_septe_mber.jpg?itok=xB3flKaS\n  'Europe' seminar with Anastasia Remes, European University Institute\n  21 September 2021\n  Contemporary history of Europe\n  Cultural policies  European integration\n  Conferences\n  Published  \nColor photograph of the European Coal and Steel Community Pavilion at Expo 58, Unknown author, 1958, CEAB12-531, p.94, Historical Archives of the European Union, Florence, Italy.",

Hence, curation and research of parliamentary records, as well as the development of new tools and user interfaces relevant for the parliamentary data are embedded in critical societal discussions, and bear consequences from both scholarly and citizen perspectives.\nThese developments have led to enhanced opportunities and challenges for research and development. The workshop therefore draws together scholars across different disciplines to explore and showcase results and ongoing work on creating, publishing, and using digital parliamentary data in digital humanities research and applications. The aim is to foster interaction between the scholars in the humanities, social sciences, and computational sciences.\nDeadline for submitting the papers: 13 January 2022\nRead more and apply\n\n      Elisa Gorgaini\n 26 November 2021",

Yet some of the memories aren’t so warm: uncomfortable shoes, the buffet littered with dietary no-nos, some especially cringeworthy circus-themed post-lunch entertainment, and even connectivity problems when I misplaced my adapter! \nBut I also remember my first online conference, the Creative Commons Global Summit in November, 2020. As a conference volunteer, I remember how we scrambled to figure out what was possible: Recording? Networking? Translation?  Dance party? It was a formative and transformative experience. And as transformative as it was for me, it was no doubt even more transformative for people who rarely had access to in-person conferences.\nNow, with over a year of online conferences to learn from, it’s clear the innovations of online conferencing have set guideposts for the future of scholarly communication. Over the past nine months, the FORCE 2021 Organizing Committee  has worked tirelessly to create a conference that draws on the best of what we’ve all learned about global online events. Under the leadership of Osman Aldirdiri, we’ve crafted an event that aspires to be as welcoming as possible to scholarly innovators and communicators from all disciplines, geographies, communities, and career stages.\nWe hope you will join us December 7-9 at FORCE2021: Joining Forces to Advance the Future of Research Communications for an event centering exchange and open discussion. We are members of all of the communities that make up FORCE11--scholars, librarians, archivists, publishers, research funders, and more, broadly and inclusively defined. If you care about the future of research communications and the technologies that are enabling new possibilities, learn more about the conference and REGISTER.\n-Jennifer Miller for the FORCE2021 Organizing Committee",

        <p>Good news for Australian archives users – you can now use Zotero to capture item details and digitised files from the collections of the Public Record Office Victoria and the Queensland State Archives!
What is Zotero?
According to the Zotero website:
Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research.
While you can use it instead of commercial reference managers like EndNote, Zotero is much, much more. I use Zotero as my personal research database, capturing publications, websites, PDFs, as well as records from a growing number of GLAM collections. You can add tags and notes to items, organise them into collections, and annotate PDFs and website captures. You can also share your collections, create groups to collaborate with others, and acc…</p>

        <p>Rondo is a predominantly African American neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota, with a familiar story. Across the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, an estimated 1,600 communities of color were destroyed by highway construction. Rondo was one of these neighborhoods, sacrificed to the asphalt as cities across the country weaponized their arteries by building “white roads through Black bedrooms.”
Marvin Anderson remembers what the City of St. Paul did to his neighborhood, and he has made it his life’s mission to Remember Rondo. In 2015, Mr. Anderson and Rebecca Wingo joined forces to create RememberingRondo.org, a vibrant history hub with a community-based digital archive, a map of Rondo’s historic businesses, and much more. While Wingo’s academic institution initially hosted the project, …</p>

        <p>Archiving has always been about selecting, preserving and making available. But while historians and archivists share a common interest in archived information, their vision of material relevance and record-keeping occasionally differ. Additionally to this ancient divide, digital archiving has brought new challenges for both communities.
In this paper, I will first discuss conceptual continuity lines between analog and digital archiving of textual material at a general level. In a second step, I will examine both analog and digital archiving under the lens of their environmental footprint and the challenges it brings about in a context of resource shortage like the climate and biodiversity crisis. I will not concentrate solely on strategies pertaining to the archived material itself, but w…</p>

Professor of History of Art



Julie Nelson Davis specializes in the arts and material cultures of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Japan, with a focus on prints, paintings, and illustrated books. One of the leaders in the field of ukiyo-e (“images of the floating world”), Davis takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding these works in context, exploring issues related to artistic practice, authorship, gender, and censorship, among others. Selected as a Guggenheim Fellow for 2021, Davis is working on a new project about imitation, homage, and fabrication in ukiyo-e painting as well as second project on artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) and illustrated books.

        <p>This conference aims to address the often-overlooked genealogies of digital history and the recurring issue of »blind spots« within the field regarding its own past.

        <p>HASS researchers often compile data in spreadsheets. Sometimes they want to ‘publish’ this data online in a form that encourages others to use and explore – but how? I’ve just added a simple tool to the GLAM Workbench that helps you construct a url that will open a CSV file as a searchable database using Datasette-Lite.
What’s Datasette?
Datasette is a fantastic tool that helps you publish your data as an interactive website. There’s a few different varieties of Datasette, but Datasette-Lite is probably the easiest, as you don’t need to install any software. Datasette-Lite runs completely within your web browser, converting your data into into a searchable database on demand.
I’m using Datasette-Lite throughout the GLAM Workbench. For example, try clicking the Explore in Datasette buttons …</p>

        <p>I had to update my sadly-neglected CV, so of course I ended up renovating the whole of my personal website at timsherratt.au.  To start with, I migrated my CV from Pages to Markdown. This made it easy to integrate the CV’s content into the site’s about me page. As i was updating the CV, I tried to get as many as possible of my publications and presentations into Zenodo for easy access and safekeeping. This means that the about me page now has a long list of publications and presentations, dating back more than 20 years, that are (almost) all available online.

While I was fiddling about with the content, I thought I should probably update the theme as well. The site now uses Minimal Mistakes and will display in either dark or light mode depending on your system and browser settings. Hopefully I can ignore it for a few more years now!</p>

        <p>The Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench includes a number of notebooks and datasets that document the context and content of the newspaper corpus. I’ve just updated a few of these datasets:
Total number of issues per year for each newspaper in Trove
Complete list of issues for every newspaper in Trove
Trove newspapers with non-English language content
Trove newspapers with articles published after 1954
OCR corrections in Trove newspapers

I’ve also used the issues data to update my visualisation of the number of digitised newspaper issues in Trove published every day from 1803 to 2021 (there’s a lot of data so it can take a little while to load!).
The notebooks in the Trove newspapers section still need to be updated to work with version 3 of the Trove API. I’m part way through and should get it finished in the next few weeks. I’ll also be adding some more of this data into the Understanding the digitised newspapers section of the Trove Data Guide.</p>

        <p>The recently finished Australian Historical Association conference in Adelaide included a digital history stream sponsored by the Australian Research Data Commons. I’ve listed the details of all the presentations below. I also thought it might be useful to try and bring together links to the various tools, platforms, and projects mentioned during the digital history sessions. I’m relying on my memory and what I could find by googling, so please let me know if I’ve missed something!

        <p>A fairly intensive period of work came to an end today as I delivered a workshop on ‘Understanding Trove’ at the Australian Historical Association’s annual conference in Adelaide. In effect, the workshop was also the launch of the Trove Data Guide, which I’ve been developing as part of the ARDC’s Community Data Lab. The ARDC sponsored today’s workshop and has provided bursaries to help five ECRs and HDRs participate in the conference’s digital history stream.
Thanks to everyone who came to the workshop. It was great to have so much interest in developing a critical understanding of Trove and thinking about new research uses for Trove data. If you couldn’t make it, the slides are available below. Like the Trove Data Guide, the GLAM Workbench and pretty much everything else I do, the slides are openly licensed so feel free to share and reuse if any of it is useful to you.

Now I think I need a day off before I start thinking about the topics I’d still like to add to the Trove Data Guide…</p>

        <p>While historical video games set in Antiquity tend to focus on military gameplay, economic aspects such as resource exploitation and management have always been a significant part of the ludic depiction of the ancient world, from 4X grand strategy games, to city builders, to action-adventures. The talk takes a closer look at how economy and trade are (mis)represented and utilised in “ancient” video games, from Hamurabi (1973) to Builders of Egypt (2020).
Christian Rollinger is Reader in Ancient History at the University of Trier and currently a Visiting Professor at the University of Potsdam. His research interests include the economic and cultural history of the late Roman republic, the late Roman empire, ancient monarchies generally, and Classical Receptions in modern popular media.

        <p>The Trove Data Guide aims to help researchers understand, access, and use data from Trove. But just because it’s about ‘data’ doesn’t mean  you need to be able to code. To understand Trove data and its  possibilities for research, you first need to understand Trove itself –  its history, its structure, its assumptions, and its limits. This  knowledge is useful to any Trove user.
For example, all Trove users would benefit from knowing more about works and versions, or how to use the ‘simple’ search box for complex queries. There’s also an introduction to what’s in (and not in) the digitised newspapers, and similar overviews for other digitised content such as books, parliamentary papers, and oral histories.

Number of newspapers articles in Trove by publication year, showing the change from 2011 to 2022
Several sections document the way the web interface works (or doesn’t work). There’s a field guide to the various interfaces and identifiers you might come across, and details of options for downloading data. The Trove Data Guide fills many gaps in the official Trove  documentation, so check here if you run into problems, or can’t figure  out how to achieve a particular task. Perhaps you were wondering how to download digitised images at their highest available resolution?
For people who are more comfortable with code there are plenty of  useful snippets and complete working examples. For example there are  sections that document how to get metadata, text, and images from newspapers, and other digitised resources. There are also a series of ‘HOW TO’ pages that describe more complex data access methods.
But what can you do with Trove data? The Trove Data Guide’s Pathways provide detailed tutorials that lead you step by step through examples  of packaging Trove data for use with other digital tools. Use these  examples as a starting point in planning your own projects.</p>

        <p>For this part of the ARDC’s Community Data Lab project, I’ve been focusing in particular on adding a series of researcher pathways to the Trove Data Guide. These pathways link data from Trove to a variety of tools and approaches and include five detailed tutorials. The first four were:
Analysing keywords in Trove’s digitised newspapers
Working with a Trove collection in Tropy
Comparing manuscript collections in Mirador
Sharing a Trove List as a CollectionBuilder exhibition
I’ve now added the fifth and final (for now) tutorial:
Create a layer in the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Placenames using metadata from Trove’s digitised maps
As has been the way in a lot of TDG development, this tutorial builds on and extends resources available through the GLAM Workbench. The Trove maps section of the GLAM Workbench already included a dataset of digitised maps and their coordinates, but for this tutorial I added a notebook that lets you create a subset of maps relating to a particular region. It does this by putting all the available map locations on world map. You then draw a rectangle on the map to select a region and display details of all the maps whose centre points fall within that region. It also displays links to download your new dataset as either a CSV or GeoJSON file.

The tutorial walks you through this process, then demonstrates how you can upload data from the CSV file to create a new layer in the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Placenames (GHAP).

This part of the Trove Data Guide project is now finished, but I’ll be continuing to add and refine content. If you have any suggestions for additional tutorials, feel free to add them to the ideas board (no promises though!).</p>

Undergrads expand stories behind historic slavery lawsuits



The handwriting on the screen can be vexing, but the stories are fascinating.
Zoe Williams, a rising sophomore at Howard University in Washington, D.C., carefully read the scrawled words of a 200-year-old document on her computer screen in the Digital Legal Research Lab, a lab in the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Center for Digital Research in the Humanities.
“That is easily the biggest challenge,” Williams said. “You do get used to the handwriting as you go, and some pages are easier than others, but there have been some that look like chicken scratch.”
As the reading started to flow more easily, Williams began to untwine and understand the legal hurdles of an enslaved man named Paul Jones who was seeking…</p>

        <p>Taking a new generation of Holocaust comics as a point of departure, the lecture seeks to historicize different strategies of Holocaust visualization within their respective media ecological contexts. I am particularly interested in exploring the interaction between the structural affordances of analogue, electronic, and digital media and their respective political-normative settings. More specifically, I would like to test the hypothesis that technological and social transformations have prompted key institutions and stake holders to redefine the limits of Holocaust representation inadvertently setting Holocaust memory on a path of reduced visibility.

        <p>Rap Lyrics Corpora: Comparing Tools, Merging Data and Presenting in Paris

            
By Alena Němcová Polická
Since February 2023, preparations have been underway to reshape the RapCor database of the DIGITALIA MUNI ARTS infrastructure - a local node of LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ - to enable long-term storage in order to open access to research data and to create a new repository system for francophone rap albums and lyrics. The specificity of the project lies in the fact that it is not only a database of linguistic data on French (focused mainly on the collection, morpho-semantic and lexicographic description of substandard expressions and on the lemmatisation of graphically unstable sociolectisms and dynamically evolving neologisms), but also a repository of dematerialised musical media for th…</p>

        <p>You’ve been collecting and annotating items relating to your research  project in a Trove List. You’d like to display the contents of your list as an online exhibition for others to explore. But how? One possible approach is now documented in the Trove Data Guide. I’ve added a tutorial which walks through the process of using a GLAM Workbench notebook to extract and process data from a Trove List, before uploading it to CollectionBuilder to create an instant exhibition.

CollectionBuilder creates online exhibitions using static web technologies. It provides a GitHub Pages template repository, so all you need to do to create an exhibition is upload your metadata and images to GitHub. The GLAM Workbench notebook gets your list data from the Trove API, and enriches it a bit to take advantage of CollectionBuilder’s built-in visualisations. For example, if there’s any digitised maps in your list, the notebook will try and extract their coordinates from the digitised map viewer and add them to the metadata so that CollectionViewer can display the location on a map. The notebook also downloads images of newspaper articles and other digitsed resources, and links them to the metadata, ready for upload.

A recently developed topic modelling tool has not only proven to be versatile in terms of its potential applications, but has also been used as a way to introduce less technical SSH scholars to digital methods. The tool, Topics2Themes, was developed by Maria Skeppstedt in collaboration with several researchers, including colleagues from the Swedish CLARIN node at the government agency Institute for Language and Folklore (Isof).

        <p>Au Portugal, il y a 50 ans, le 25 avril 1974, de jeunes officiers, soutenus par une grande partie de la population, renversaient l’Estado Novo, régime autoritaire mis en place par António de Oliveira Salazar en 1933. La fin de cette dictature de près de 40 ans signera également l’arrêt de mort d’un empire colonial européen majeur. Trop souvent réduite à un coup d’État pacifique qui ne dure que quelques heures, la Révolution des Œillets et ses conséquences (décolonisation, mobilisations sociales, quête d’une voie socialiste originale) sont encore mal connues.

        <p>There’s a new draft tutorial in the development version of the Trove Data Guide. It walks through the process of harvesting a collection of digitised newspaper articles from Trove, reshaping the harvest to create sub-collections, and then loading the data into the Keyword Analysis Tool provided by the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP).

Along the way it goes into a fair bit of detail about constructing searches, using the Trove Newspaper Harvester, and thinking about your data. Much of the information on creating and reshaping datasets would apply to using the digitised newspapers with other analysis tools as well.</p>

        <p>I’ve just created a GitHub repository template that you can use to get your own Mirador version 3 installation running in minutes. You can also configure it to display local or remote IIIF manifests. I was thinking that it could be useful for researchers who want to create their own customised Mirador workspaces to examine a particular set of documents, but don’t want to install any software or fiddle about on the command-line.

I’ve been doing a lot with IIIF lately. First a GLAM Workbench notebook to save a collection of images from Trove as an IIIF manifest. Then a tutorial for the Trove Data Guide that walks through the whole process of generating an IIIF manifest from Trove, then loading the manifest into Tropy for analysis and annotation.

        <p>Kiara is the data orchestration engine developed by the DHARPA project with a goal of re-thinking the “black boxes” of historical research. It uses a modular approach to let users re-use tried and tested analytical workflows, as well as create new ones from existing building blocks. It also helps you manage your research data, and augment it with automatically-, semi-automatically-, and manually- created metadata.

        <p>In his proposal for the Dartmouth summer research project (1955-1956), Nathaniel Rochester wondered whether injecting some randomness into a machine could make it creative. But how to control this randomness to prevent machines crashing and ensure the generated content’s relevance ? Seventy years later, the so-called « generative AI » seems to have solved the problem, or at least circumvented some obstacles. Despite the difficulty of estimating what goes on inside deep neural networks, we will briefly describe what « creativity » is about in generative AIs (interpolation in a latent space) and the current controversy over how to evaluate it using dedicated benchmarks. Then, drawing from literature and philosophy (Borges, Caillois, Bachelard), we will challenge the claim that it can be compared to human creativity. Finally, we will examine how these machines don’t have to be creative like humans to trigger an epochal change that we need to characterize.

        <p>Hey Australian Hansard fans, I’ve done a complete reharvest of all of the Commonwealth Hansard XML files from 1901 to 1980 from ParlInfo. There’s been lots of improvements/corrections, and most of the file names have changed (they now have a version flag). The improvements seem to be ongoing, so I’ll try to harvest more regularly from now on. You can download the lot from the GitHub repository.
I still need to load the updated XML into the Historic Hansard site, but that’s going to have to wait  for a month or two…</p>

        <p>I’ve just added a couple of new notebooks to the Trove Newspaper &amp; Gazette Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench.
Using the Trove Harvester as a Python package provides a basic example of using the trove-newspaper-harvester Python package. While there’s already a simple web app version of the harvester, I wanted a notebook version running in the JupyterLab interface that I could integrate with other tools and notebooks. All you need to do to harvest all the articles in a Trove newspaper search is paste in your Trove API key and the search query url from the Trove web interface.

Reshaping your newspaper harvest provides a slice and dice wonder tool for Trove newspaper harvests, enabling you to repackage OCRd text by decade, year, and  newspaper title. It saves the results as zip files, concatenated text files, or CSV files with embedded text. These repackaged slices should  suit a variety of text analysis tools and questions. I’ve be thinking about doing something like this for a while, and think it should be quite useful.
In my usual way, I started off writing a tutorial for the Trove Data Guide on ways of loading digitised newspaper data into text analysis tools and then realised I needed these notebooks to fill in some gaps in the data processing pipeline. So after a day or two of yak shaving I now have to get back to the tutorial.</p>

        <p>Do we play video games or do video games play us? Is nonhuman play a mere paradox or the future of gaming? And what do video games have to do with quantum theory? In the talk based on her book Playing at a Distance (MIT Press 2022), Sonia Fizek will engage with these questions, proposing new ways to think about games and play that decenter the human player and explore a variety of play formats and practices that require surprisingly little human action. Idling in clicker games, wandering in walking simulators, automating gameplay with bots, or simply watching games rather than playing them—Fizek will argue that these seemingly marginal cases are central to understanding how we play in the digital age.

Sonia Fizek is a media and games scholar. She holds a professorship in Media and Game Studies at the Cologne Game Lab at TH Köln – University of Applied Sciences. Fizek is also a visiting professor at the University of Lower Silesia in Wroclaw (Poland)  and a co-editor-in-chief of the international Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds. In her latest book Playing at a Distance (MIT Press 2022), she explores the borderlands of video game aesthetic with focus on automation, AI and posthuman forms of play. Fizek’s current research concentrates on the environmental aspects of video games. She participates in two international projects: “STRATEGIES – Sustainable Transition for Europe’s Game Industries” (2024-2027), and “Greening Games. Building Higher Education Resources for Sustainable Video Game Production, Design &amp; Critical Game Studies” (2021-2024).

        <p>Last week I added a notebook to the GLAM Workbench that saves a collection of images from Trove as an IIIF manifest. This week I’ve written a tutorial that shows how you can use the notebook to load the collection data in Tropy – a desktop tool for managing and annotating images for research.

This is the first tutorial in the Trove Data Guide’s Research Pathways section. While most of the TDG documents the types of data available in Trove and how you can access it, the pathways aim to connect Trove data with other tools and platforms – to point at possibilities for analysis, enrichment, and sharing. For example, I’m planning tutorials on packaging OCRd text from Trove for use with text analysis tools, as well as ways of sharing selected data through tools like CollectionBuilder, and Datasette.
If you have any ideas for additional tutorials, feel free to add them to the ideas board in GitHub.</p>

        <p>The Family of Man was an exhibition of some five hundred photographs from around the world, curated by Edward Steichen for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York in 1955. After its installation at MoMA, and under the auspices of the United States Information Agency, copies of the exhibition then toured close to fifty countries. By the end of its international tour the exhibition had been seen by almost ten million people, making it the most successful event of the early decades of the cultural Cold War. This paper will consider the international reception of The Family of Man. Taking India and Japan as case studies, it will suggest the ways in which intersection of Steichen’s work and conception with local social and political circumstances inflected and reshaped the meanings of the exhibition.

        <p>I’ve just added a new notebook to the Trove images section of the GLAM Workbench. It helps you save a collection of digitised images as an IIIF manifest. But what does that mean? It means the notebook packages up all the metadata describing the images in a standard form that can be used with a variety of IIIF-compliant tools. These tools let you do things with the collections that you can’t do in Trove’s own interface.
Perhaps you’d like to browse the complete digitised contents of Sir Edmund Barton’s manuscript collection, without all the back and forth and up and down navigation imposed by the Trove web interface. Here you go, thanks to IIIF!

Digital Humanities Summer Fellowships awarded to four doctoral students



The Center for Digital Research in the Humanities announced its 2024 cohort of Digital Humanities Summer Fellows.
“This year we had the highest number of applications we’ve ever received, with lots of amazing, meritorious projects,” said Carrie Heitman, associate director and fellow of the CDRH and director of the 2024 Digital Humanities Summer Fellowships.
According to Heitman, the selection process was extremely difficult, but she had help from the other members of the CDRH’s Student-Centered Committee who reviewed the applications with her. Kevin McMullen, Katrina Jagodinsky, and Laura Weakly helped Heitman bring together a dynamic group of young scholars who will continue to push the field of…</p>

It’s assembled a collection of more than 80,000 archived website titles, organised into subjects and collections.

Trove’s digitised collection viewer includes a download option. But in most cases that seems to be limited to downloading 20 images at a time. Part of the reason for that is probably because the images are zipped up into a single file, which could get very large if 100, or 200 images were added.
Another limitation of the built-in download option is that the images are often fairly low resolution copies (many have a maximum width of 1000px). The…</p>

        <p>&#x27;Biographies of Struggle&#x27; is a documentary on a drawn-out unrest that took place at the ThyssenKrupp-AST-Terni steelworks in Central Italy in 2014, one of the longest steelworkers’ strike in Italy since the last wave of labour unrest in the ‘80s. Threatened by 550 job cuts and a partial closure, the Terni factory is the framework in which 11 participants express their discordant thoughts and opinions about the ongoing 7-months-long dispute, and 45-days-long strike. Drawing on their biographies and work experiences, the protagonists depict a fragmented portrait of one of the oldest Italian working class communities, while fighting mass layoffs.
This documentary is inscribed in an ethnographic research which addresses the ways in which labour activism contributes to the articulation of worki…</p>

        <p>La Revue d’Histoire de la Shoah présente un ample dossier consacré à un pays dont le statut pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale et la relation avec sa minorité juive sont très particuliers : le Grand-duché de Luxembourg. Au carrefour de la France, de la Belgique et de l’Allemagne, on estime actuellement que près de 5.000 personnes considérées comme juives y vivaient avant l’invasion allemande du 10 mai 1940 ; d’après l’état actuel des recherches, 1.227 sont mortes après avoir été déportées de Luxembourg, Belgique et France ; moins de 1.000 revinrent après la guerre au Luxembourg.

        <p>Remnants of material and visual cultures throughout history can be traced as millions of museum objects have been, and are, digitised and published online. The metadata of these online museum objects can be used as data to analyse the development of concepts, events or technological and social innovations in history by using information retrieval, quantitative and machine learning methods. They can also be used as primary sources to trace the history of and changes in the representation of concepts or events and their interpretation. How do online museum catalogue data reflect multiple perspectives on specific topics? Objects relating to, for example, female labour or ethnic minorities can be described in online catalogue metadata in a variety of ways. A drawing of an old Jew may be repres…</p>

        <p>Developed as part of the Land of Memory Interreg project, “Before the War” is a historical strategy board game that aims to provide an understanding of the issues and mechanisms related to wars. Players explore scenarios inspired by real-life historical events, and are given the chance to make crucial decisions and potentially rewrite history. World balance depends on the players’ ability to navigate diplomatic crises and maintain peace.
Project coordinator Mélanie Petton and game designer Vincenzo Bianca will illustrate the game development process and share their insights on how play can provide an original approach to exploring and understanding complex political dynamics and societal issues.

        <p>The ProviLux research project focuses on the issue of looted cultural property in the collections of three institutions in Luxembourg: the National Library, the National Museum, and the Villa Vauban Art Collection, part of the City Museum of Luxembourg (Les 2 Musées de la Ville de Luxembourg). The signing of an agreement between the Jewish Consistory and the State of Luxembourg on January 27, 2021, marked a key moment in the launch of provenance research in the country&#x27;s major cultural institutions. This initiative involves mapping wartime acquisitions, examining archival documentation and the provenance of art objects, and evaluating the data collected during the pilot phase of the ProviLux project.

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>In my work on the Trove Data Guide I’ve started sketching out a series of research pathways. These are intended as ways of connecting Trove data to tools and questions – providing examples of the steps involved in gathering, preparing, and using data to explore particular research topics.
I’ve currently defined six pathways, roughly based on different types of data that you can get from Trove:
Text
Images
Structured data
Maps and places
Networks and relationships
Creating collections
‘Creating collections’ is a bit different I suppose, as it’s meant to relate to the work of assembling research collections from data in Trove – for example, creating a collection of annotated newspaper articles in Omeka.
I have some ideas, of course, about the types of tutorials and examples to include in each pathway, but I’m wondering what you would like to see. What would you like to be able to do with Trove data?
You might get some inspiration by browsing through what’s already in the Trove Data Guide and the GLAM Workbench, or perhaps you have a research question that’s foundered because you couldn’t get the data you needed out of Trove. If you have any ideas please share them via the TDG’s ideas board. This is a chance to get some of your gnarly Trove data problems solved!
Note that the TDG links in this post go to the development version, which changes frequently. There is also a published version that doesn’t include the latest content.</p>

        <p>You probably know that when you select the Download as Image option for a digitised newspaper article in Trove what you get back is not actually an image ­– it’s an HTML document, in which the original image has been sliced up to try and fit on an A4 page when printed. So this article:

Ends up looking like this!!

So what do you do when you just want an image of an article as it appeared in the newspaper? Some years ago I figured out a workaround that involves scraping the OCR positional data that’s embedded in Trove’s newspaper viewer and cropping the article from a high-resolution image of the page. The method is documented in the GLAM Workbench and the Trove Data Guide, and I’ve packaged up the code in trove-newspapers-images so you can embed it in your own projects.
I also created a…</p>

        <p>One of the biggest advantages of Transkribus is the possibility to train custom handwritten text recognition models. This unique feature allows you to tailor the automatic transcriptions to the specific handwriting or printed text in your documents, resulting in more accurate transcriptions. However, training accurate models is a skill that takes a bit of time […]

        <p>What did the transformation from ‘socialism’ to ‘democracy’ and a market economy entail? When did it begin and did it ever end? The presentation proposes a new temporality of global transformation: It argues that its beginning dates in the mid 1970s, when socialist countries tried to enter the world market in shipbuilding. Of course, the end of state socialism and the subsequent global hegemony of neoliberalism after 1989/91 remain an important watershed, but the paper points to another important caesura, the enlargement of the European Union and of the WTO after the turn of the millennium. 
In the empirical part, the presentation will focus on our (the plural form here includes Ulf Brunnbauer in Regensburg, my longterm project partner and co-author of our forthcoming “multograph”) two cas…</p>

        <p>I spend a lot of my time trying to highlight the wealth of resources available through Trove – whether that’s 25,000 digitised Parliamentary Papers, 6,000 oral histories you can listen to online, or 3,471 full-page editorial cartoons from The Bulletin. Most recently I’ve been working on digitised periodicals, developing a new section for the Trove Data Guide. But as I was harvesting data about the 900 periodicals and 37,000 issues that had so far been digitised, I wondered about periodicals that were born digital – in particular, those that had been submitted to the National Library by publishers and authors through the National eDeposit Scheme (NED). It turns out, there’s a lot more than I realised.

Open access in the sciences, a.k.a. Open Science, has become well established, especially so after the 2013 and 2022 Memoranda from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) reinforcing the idea that everyone, not just scholars at wealthy institutions, should have access to important and useful research, especially so when that research is paid for with public money.

Marc Ridgell is a first-year PhD student in Africana Studies and William Fontaine Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. Their prospective dissertation uses critical ethnography and GIS mapping to examine how Black queer and trans people experience community amid active gentrification, policing, and larger neoliberal affects in Philadelphia. Their summer Price Lab project envisions a public-facing website that exhibits archives, oral histories, and maps of Black LGBTQ+ life and organizing in Philadelphia. 
 
They graduated magna cum laude with their B.A. from Washington University in St. Louis in May 2023. While at WashU, they completed a senior thesis through the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship, Schomburg-Mellon Humanities Summer Institute, and Leadership Alliance at the University of Chicago.

OSCARS cascading grants: deadline 15 May
As you might have seen at OSCARS 1st Open Call for Open Science Projects and Services or at EU Funding &amp; Tenders Portal there is an interesting opportunity to submit proposals via the OSCARS project. There is a significant budget (13 mio EUR) and with a funding rate between 100k and 250k EUR this means that around 50 to 100 proposals can be funded.
We recently published some ideas about how to relate proposals to the CLARIN and SSHOC research infrastructures.
CLARIN technical open hour, Monday 8 April at 11:00 CEST
The next edition of the CLARIN technology open hour is planned for Monday 8 April at 11:00 CEST. You can join virtually and ask our developers and infrastructure specialists anything. The special topic of this open hour is CLARIN-DSpace version 7. Anyone is welcome to join!
Deadline Centre Assessment Round approaching
The deadline for the upcoming B-centre assessment round is 30 April 2024.
If you would like to participate in this 23rd round, please make sure to use:
The updated CoreTrustSeal 2023-2025 and AMT platform.
The latest version of the B-centre checklist (7.4). The difference with the previous version is the addition of two (optional) recommendations at the end of the document, on the use of the attribute checker and attribute aggregator.

        <p>Suite aux travaux de la Commission spéciale pour l&#x27;étude des spoliations des biens juifs au Luxembourg pendant les années de guerre 1940-1945 (2001-2009), trois idées dominaient la compréhension de la dépossession des personnes considérées comme juives au Luxembourg pendant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale. La première, reprenant la phrase de Paul Cerf, était de penser qu’il n’y avait « point de Rothschild parmi les juifs luxembourgeois », autrement dit qu’il n’y avait pas de collection d’œuvres d’art parmi cette population. La deuxième était que les bénéficiaires de la dépossession furent les organisations allemandes et leurs soutiens. La troisième était que le montant global de la dépossession pouvait être évalué sur la base de la comptabilité du Chef der Zivilverwaltung, l’administration civile allemande. Par une approche microhistorique et l’étude de deux cas – celui des propriétaires d’œuvres d’art et celui des habitants d’un quartier de la ville d’Esch-sur-Alzette – la thèse remet en question ces idées et ouvre la voie à de nouveaux développements des Holocaust studies sur un territoire jusqu’ici peu étudié.

CLARIN is proud to be participating partner, along with several CLARIN nodes as beneficiaries: University of Sheffield (UK), Charles University, Prague (CZ), LM University, Munich (DE), Radboud University, Nijmegen (NL), and Athena-RC / ISLP (GR).
The Transnational Access Grant call will be of special interest to scholars interested in benefitting from this scheme, which aims to recruit and support approximately 200 arts and humanities researchers with mentorship and access to knowledge, data and tools from 14 different institutions across Europe. 
You can also connect with ATRIUM on Twitter/X and LinkedIn.

        <p>The Luxembourg steel industry and its main company, ARBED, have undergone a profound transformation since the mid-1970s. Triggered by the economic crisis of 1973, this was characterised by the modernisation and closure of plants, the specialisation of production, international expansion and a far-reaching reduction in the workforce, a process often summarised under the term deindustrialisation. Part of this corporate transformation was the acquisition of the former VEB Maxhütte Unterwellenborn in Thuringia in 1992 and its transformation into a modern and profitable steelworks, making around ninety per cent of the former workers redundant and leading to a delayed but similar process of deindustrialisation. The project examines the history of ARBED between 1973 and 2001, starting from this point of transformation in 1992, and analyses the preconditions and related developments of this takeover, as well as its implications and consequences for ARBED&#x27;s activities in Thuringia and in Luxembourg. Using a transnational economic history approach, the project aims to analyse the interconnections between processes of deindustrialisation in Western and post-socialist Europe.

        <p>The Trove Periodicals section of the GLAM Workbench has been updated! Some changes were necessary to make use of version 3 of the Trove API, but I’ve also taken the chance to reorganise things a bit – starting with the name. This section used to be called ‘Trove journals’, reflecting the naming of Trove’s ‘Journals’ zone. But zones have gone, and periodicals are now spread across multiple categories, so I thought a name change was necessary to better reflect the type of content being examined.
What periodicals have been digitised?
It’s surprising difficult to find out what periodicals have actually been digitised in Trove. There’s no straightforward list of titles as there is in the newspapers category. Over the years I’ve created a variety of lists and tools to try and overcome this. I’m …</p>

10th annual Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities is April 4-5



The 10th annual Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities is slated for April 4-5 in the Willa Cather Dining Complex at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.
This year’s forum, “From Exclusion to Inclusion: Creating Responsible and Equitable Information and AI Systems for Digital Cultural Heritage,” is sponsored by the Office of Research and Economic Development Grand Challenges Seed Grant and the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities. Registration is required, and all presentations and events are open to the public.
A variety of scholars from around the world will discuss what it would take to develop artificial intelligence systems that manage cultural heritage materials (texts, images, videos and data) while generating new ways to contextualize the information, ask new questions and appreciate different perspectives. A key issue to be addressed in the development of this technology is making sure we are fair and unbiased in how we collect, describe and use these materials, while also teaching scholars how to understand both the technology and the social aspects involved.
The CDRH has hosted this forum since 2006, highlighting the diverse intellectual activity of the digital humanities field and showcasing the work of early career scholars.
There is more information on the  Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities website.</p>

        <p>Parmi les Italiens qui se sont installés au Luxembourg figurent de nombreux militants politiques. Si les communistes font l’objet d’études, de recherches et de publications, la présence, le rôle et les activités des anarchistes sont peu connus. Le propos de cette intervention est de donner les éléments pour une meilleure connaissance de cette présence des anarchistes au Luxembourg, en la replaçant dans le contexte de la circulation des anarchistes italiens pour qui, alors qu’ils sont souvent forcés à l’exil et expulsés des démocraties européennes, le Luxembourg, notamment la ville d’Esch-sur-Alzette, est un point de passage obligé sur les routes européennes.

Ce sont autant de façons d’aborder, écrire, analyser, transmettre de nouvelles visions de l’histoire européenne, appuyées sur des sources et formats originaux. Nous vous invitons à les découvrir au cours de ce Forum Z. Élargir l’histoire européenne à de nouveaux publics, raconter l’histoire européenne différemment, c’est aussi, à l’occasion du 20ème anniversaire de l’élargissement de 2004, penser celui-ci autrement, comme y invitera le second temps de cet évènement.

        <p>Obituary: Jon Arild Olsen 1965–2024

            
Written by colleagues at the National Library of Norway
  



      

It is with great sadness that we received the message that Jon Arild Olsen passed away on March 16, 2024, after long-term illness.
He was the coordinator of the Norwegian Language Bank at the National Library of Norway and involved in multiple international language technology research initiatives, among them CLARIN. Jon Arild was also the Norwegian national delegate to the CLARIN General Assembly for many years.
Jon Arild was a humanist at heart as a scholar of French philology. He earned his PhD in French literature studies at the University of Oslo in 2002, with a dissertation on the theory of the novel. He later worked in the research administration at the University of Oslo until he joined the National Library of Norway in 2009, where he became the head of the research department in 2011. He was in later years very inspired by the advances within digital humanities and language technology and he also published within these areas.
Jon Arild was a true European and believer in international cooperation, having lived in France for many years. He had friends everywhere and was surrounded by an aura of calmness, rationality and humour, which we will deeply miss.

        <p>│By Olivia McDermott, Gale Ambassador at the University of Liverpool│ For a subject such as drama, primary sources are continuously overlooked. Much academic study preceding degree level tends to focus on the practical realm of theatre. Though it is an important aspect, this sometimes leads to contextual ideas being ignored.

          <h3>A new way to explore editorial cartoons from *The Bulletin*<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>About five years ago I created a collection of full-page editorial cartoons from The Bulletin, harvested from Trove. Through a process that might be politely described as ‘iterative’, I fiddled with an assortment of queries and methods until I had at least one cartoon from every issue published between 4 September 1886 and 17 September 1952 – 3,471 cartoons in total. The details of the collection and how I created it are available in the Trove periodicals section of the GLAM Workbench.
Last night, as I was tidying up a new release of the Trove periodicals repository, I had a thought – why not put all of the details of the cartoons in a little database and make it available using Datasette-Lite for easy exploration? So I did.
Try it now!

One of the coolest new features is that I’ve harvested the OCRd text from each page containing a cartoon and created a full-text index. This means you can find cartoons by searching for words in their captions! Other features include embedded thumbnail images and links to download high-resolution versions of each page image.
In creating the database, I realised there were a few problems with the original metadata (dodgy page numbers), so I’ve fixed that up as well. I’ve also moved the mega zip download of every image (over 60gb) from the unfortunately deceased CloudStor service to AWS.</p>

        <p>The conference aims to critically (re)assess the value(s) of the Digital for the field of Jewish Studies as it has been developed and discussed over the past ten years.
Including all phases of research and dissemination from collecting and exploring to constructing and communicating, we will discuss the benefits and pitfalls of the Digital in general and for the field of Jewish Studies in particular. This can be done both from a retrospective—what has worked well and which promises have and have not yet been fulfilled—and from a forward-looking perspective—highlighting directions that might be worth pursuing. In doing so, we take up the recent critical turn in DH and apply it to the field of Jewish Studies. The event includes a hands-on-hackathon.
The full program can be consulted here. 
The conference and Hackathon is generously supported by the European Association for Jewish Studies (EAJS) Conference Grant Programme in European Jewish Studies.
Please register by 31 March 2024 at: https://forms.gle/7RE5yNmdESQddofx7
Please note that registration for the conference and the hackathon will take place separately. Please indicate in the form for which event/days you would like to register for (you can also register for both). Please also note that we only have a limited number of places. Places will be allocated in the order in which registrations are received.

An International Symposium at the Price Lab for Digital Humanities, co-organized with the Section for Sociology of Literature, Uppsala University.
This symposium marks the rise in recent years of empirical reader studies: data-driven research into what, why, and how people read. The full emergence of this field has been a long time coming.  Literary scholars have never shown much interest in conducting empirical study of contemporary reading practices among ordinary, non-professional, non-academic people.  Janice Radway’s Reading the Romance (1984) is the glaring exception that proves the rule.  By far the most widely-cited study of amateur literary readers, Radway’s book has been more influential for its findings abou…</p>

        <p>History, heritage, and games: three steps taken on a journey through time. The talk will begin with an examination of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (PLC) historical past. It will then introduce a framework of multiple heritage discourses that shape the collective memory of the PLC in 21st-century Poland. The framework explains the diversity of mental models used for worldbuilding and narrative design in Polish heritage narratives. All this leads to a demonstration of how these elements manifest in PLC-based game settings.
Michał Mochocki (PhD in Literature, Dr. habil. in Culture Studies), serves as the Executive Editor of the European Historical Game Studies journal, and works as an Associate Professor at Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz, Poland. His primary research interest is historical role-playing games, which he examines from the angles of transmedia narratology and heritage studies. He worked as Lead Writer on the BEAST: False Prophet video game.

In 2016, Franco Morretti argued that “somehow digital humanities has managed to secure for itself this endless infancy, in which it is always a future promise.”1 In the years since, little has changed. Whilst there has been exponential growth in the number of resources, tools, and methodological discussions in the digital humanities, there remains limited contribution towards traditional historical narratives implementing these, increasing the apparent gap between DH and traditional history. Terminology in the digital humanities – networks, mapping, modelling – has long been used metaphorically to explore historical phenomenon; yet in digitalizing t…</p>

Course encourages students to grapple with AI’s implications



The world was collectively agog as Open AI recently unveiled its new artificial intelligence video tool, Sora. Users shared colorful 3D animations and pirate ships floating on mahogany waves of coffee. A few days later, Sora was old news and Groq, an AI language tool, claimed global headlines for lightning-fast capabilities that leave ChatGPT in the proverbial dust.
And in a University of Nebraska–Lincoln classroom, Adrian Wisnicki quickly tweaked plans to incorporate these developments into class discussions — something he does often. Using cutting-edge AI tools, literature and contemporary films and articles, Wisnicki encourages students to grapple with questions related to AI and technology in the course…</p>

        <p>L’influence des médias et la désinformation sont parmi les questions vives de nos sociétés contemporaines. Les reconfigurations des espaces médiatiques, notamment en ligne, conduisent à de nouvelles offres et de nouveaux usages de l’information. Le «cycle de rencontres sur l’influence des médias et la désinformation» organisé dans la Grande Région est une action culturelle qui souhaite participer à stimuler le regard critique des citoyens sur l’actualité.
Entre 2024 et 2026, l’Université de Lorraine et l’Université du Luxembourg proposeront 6 conférences en Lorraine et au Luxembourg avec un.e chercheur.e en SHS, un.e journaliste et un.e animateur.rice spécialiste du sujet. Chaque conférence traitera d’un angle différent de l’influence des médias.

        <p>In 2005 the Guinness Brewery at Park Royal, West London closed after seven decades of production. The author spent the last six months of the Brewery’s life working with a photographer to record in words and picture the site before closure. Subsequent research carried out over a twelve-year period revealed an incredibly rich story of corporate culture change, the transformation of work and the workplace as well as deindustrialisation. His research included working in archives in Dublin, Scotland and London as well as oral histories and an extensive range of visual methods. Drawing on material from his book based on the project, Voices of Guinness: An Oral History of the Park Royal Brewery, Oxford 2019, the author reflects on what that story tells us about work meaning, identity and organis…</p>

        <p>The GLAM Workbench has a brand new section aimed at helping you find and use government publications in Trove. Most of the GLAM Workbench’s existing sections focus on a particular resource format, or are related to one of Trove’s top-level categories. This didn’t quite work for government publications, as things like Parliamentary Papers are spread across multiple categories, and can encompass a variety of formats. So I thought a new section was the best way of bringing it all together.
At the moment the Trove Government section includes two notebooks and three pre-harvested datasets.
Harvest parliament press releases from Trove
Harvest details of Commonwealth Parliamentary Papers digitised in Trove
Digitised Parliamentary Papers in Trove
Press releases relating to refugees

        <p>Artificial intelligence, particularly in the form of large language models, has been at the forefront of news for several years. The majority of historians, when they express an opinion on the matter, seem mainly concerned about whether their students will be able to have essays composed by an electronic servant, and if so, to whom the obtained grade should be attributed. It is true that sometimes one looks at the finger pointing towards the star and not at the moon itself. Indeed, it seems that the impact is not so much of the invention, but of the accessibility of these devices that could be significant. The acquisition of historical data, its manipulation, as well as its interpretation are expected to take place within a workshop, with deeply renewed tools. The collapse of the cost of data acquisition and manipulation opens up multiple possibilities, among which are the potential for data-driven research, the manipulation of corpora of unprecedented size, and, paradoxically, a distancing from the text, the basic element of the historian&#x27;s diet since the origins of the discipline. We will explore these potentialities through a few examples.

        <p>Letterboxes, representing shell companies, are an emblematic symbol for a form of international capitalism that has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years and serve as a focal point for international criticism of the Luxembourgish financial system.
LETTERBOX is an innovative project that mixes recent questions in financial history with cutting-edge digital history. During the seminar we will address the challenges we have in making a very large corpus readable and present first results of our research.

        <p>How can scholarly critiques of games about WWII and Holocaust histories inform game making? And how can making a game about these topics enrich public history research? Such questions are guiding development of Beyond Nuremberg, a VR quest-game to collect, analyze, and contextualize primary sources related to the Nuremberg Trials and Holocaust. The talk will address how the team is using process analysis, formative assessments, and other critical making approaches to engage the practical, theoretical, and ethical questions that arise when using VR to engage with historical complexity, traumatic events, and still-vital human rights issues.

        <p>Encounters with new technologies often bring with them opportunities to create new narratives, but they also bear the potential to entrench existing ones that have prioritized certain perspectives in place of others. This presentation looks at the ways in which digital tools and platforms are currently being used within the museum sector across different African countries. What challenges do these platforms present and how do they allow practitioners to subvert entrenched ideologies? Most importantly, it looks at the implementation of these technologies and questions what is needed to successfully scale, implement and support a growing ecosystem of digital cultural practitioners in the region?

  ) in recent years, improved evaluation methods are needed in order to determine which translation system is best for a given dataset, language pair or domain. MATEO (MAchine Translation Evaluation Online) is a new, user-friendly tool for both experts and non-experts that answers a growing need for easy and accessible evaluation of machine translation. The software was developed by  Bram Vanroy, Arda Tezcan, Lieve Macken and Michaël Lumingu from Ghent University, and was funded by a CLARIN Bridging Gaps grant after getting seed funding from the European Association for Machine Translation.

The tool is intended to allow users to learn how to decipher and read handwriting from documents of this era. Full transcriptions of the documents can be viewed in a facing-page format, or users can highlight individual words. This tool could be used as a teaching tool to introduce students to paleography.

        <p>The Firm Worms &amp; Co was founded in the middle of the nineteenth century by the French merchant Hypolite Worms (1801-1877). From the beginning, the European and international vocation of his company led him to consider setting up in Great Britain: in Swansea, Newcastle, Great-Grimsby, … He ships French products there and brings back English coal sold on the French coast. He thus became a coal importer, then a maritime carrier opening lines linking Bordeaux, Le Havre and Rouen to Hamburg, Antwerp and to the North of Europe. Later, in the twentieth century, one sector of activity opening up prospects in another, his house will open branches or offices in Rotterdam, Genoa, Prague, Danzig, Warsaw, …

UPSKILLS Project Aimed at Enhancing the Employability of Graduates from Linguistics and Language-Related Courses Successfully Completed
UPSKILLS (UPgrading the SKIlls of Linguistics and Language Students), an Erasmus+ partnership project, successfully drew to an end on 31 August 2023. This three-year project, launched in September 2020, sought to identify and tackle the gaps and mismatches in skills for linguistics and language students. To reach this aim, consortium members from eight partner institutions, including CLARIN, worked towards a new curriculum component, which targets developing technical and transferable skills needed for industry and academic research among undergraduate students of language-related subject…</p>

        <p>In this talk, Cinderella Petz will evaluate chances and challenges when combining computational methods in historical research and address the limitations and implications of its epistemological and ontological changes. She will exemplify this on two case studies based on her doctoral research: the analysis of court records assessing the extent of political judiciary during the Dollfuß-/Schuschnigg-Regime, and the structural analysis of the influence relations of a Linked Open Data network of intellectuals. 
She will propose to take the framework of modeling seriously for digital historical research in order to successfully tackle the research design, the structuring of data, and the evaluation of analysis. Furthermore, she stresses the importance of a multimodal literacy, as well as digital and computational competences as key for a successfull implementation of an embedded digital humanities framework.

        <p>In France, as elsewhere, the Covid 19 pandemic led to a large number of grassroots archiving projets. The aim of these initiatives was to collect the &#x27;ordinary&#x27; memory of the event and thus help to build a collective memory that reflected a diversity of experiences. Using qualitative and quantitative data, this article examines the genesis of these initiatives in France and draws up the socio-economic profile of the participants, asking the question: to what extent did these operations reach the entire target population in an egalitarian manner? What kind of memory will be preserved over the long term by the archive centres, and who are the people whose words will go down in history?
Sarah Gensburger is a Full Professor of Sociology at the French National Center for Scientific Research - Sciences Po Paris. In her most recent work, she has been investigating the relationship between memory, public policies and neoliberalism. She is the author of a dozen of books among which, in the perspective of this talk, Memory on my doorstep. Chronicles of the Bataclan Neighborhood (Paris, 2015-2016), (Leuven University Press, 2019), with Gérôme Truc (eds.), Les Mémoriaux du 13 novembre (Ed. EHESS, 2020) and with Orli Fridman (eds.), The Covid-19 Pandemic and Memory. Remembrance, commemoration, and archiving in crisis (Palgrave, 2023). In 2021, she was elected President of the Memory Studies Association.

        <p>I’m continuing to slog away at the Trove Data Guide (part of the ARDC’s HASS Community Data Lab) – dumping everything I know about Trove into a format that I hope will be useful for researchers.
I’ve just finished a first pass through the section on accessing data from newspapers and gazettes, and it’s online if you want to have a look. There’s still lots of things to add, update, and reorganise, but getting the basic content of the section defined is a bit of a milestone, so I’ll allow myself a little moment of celebration. Yay!

Of course it took longer than I expected, but that’s largely due to the fact that I was sketching out related sections as I went along. You’ll see lots of pages in the navigation that only contain a list of dot points, but they’ll get filled out over the next couple of months.
The ‘Accessing data’ section is going to be the most code heavy, as it’s focused on using the API to develop reusable methods for harvesting machine-readable data. Other sections, such as ‘Understanding search’ and ‘Collections and contexts’ will be more discursive, aimed at helping all Trove users better understand what Trove is and how it works.

        <p>In this research seminar, we will discuss the ongoing extraction of data from the administrative archives of Dudelange, relying on an automated transcription, with layout detection and the automated extraction of temporal and spatial information from these sources to create historical maps.
The city of Dudelange has entered a partnership with the C²DH, for which they shared their residential cards. These administrative forms contain information on the population movements in and out of the city. These are being scanned and transcribed.
For the transcription, the project uses Transkribus to restitute not only the textual content of these administrative forms but also their structure, e.g., for each field, a tag is attached. Secondly, for the blocs of texts, a script to detect place and time information is being developed internally. All these steps should lead up to the structuration before import of the data to be visualised on a map and open these rich collections for further analysis, on the history of migration, housing, public health etc.
We invite all interested persons to join the discussion on how to improve this pipeline and share other potential uses for the extracted material.

        <p>Le 20 novembre à Belval, Caroline Muller (EA Tempora, Université de Rennes 2) et Frédéric Clavert (C²DH) invitent à une journée d&#x27;études dans le cadre de leur projet CultureHIST.
En 2012, Nicolas Delalande et Julien Vincent proposaient une description de l’historien·ne en cyborg :
« Lectores, ils ne consultent plus guère les catalogues papier des bibliothèques, mais se reportent aux bases de données disponibles en ligne ; ils débutent toute recherche par une série de sondages sur diverses banques de textes ; ils continuent de manier les index à la fin des livres, mais ne conçoivent plus de se passer des moteurs de recherche par mots ou par suites de mots1. »
En dix ans, le constat peut être fait d’une tendance renforcée : l’usage répandu et fréquent, si ce n’est universel et quotidien, des…</p>

        <p>In April 2023, we released a call for paper entitled “Is artificial intelligence the future of collective memory? Bridging AI scholarship and Memory Studies”, in order to collect papers for a special issue of Memory Studies Review. Our aim was twofold: coordinating a special issue and identifying “a network of colleagues, across the two fields, who are interested in the development of co-conceived case studies and research programs”.
To discuss the making of the informal network, we are organising on 27 September at the University of Luxembourg, Belval campus, a workshop that will be divided into two parts: the morning will be devoted to the formation of this informal network and short presentations of each other works, and the afternoon to a sort of ‘datathon’ on sources and methods we could use to explore the links between AI and collective memory.

CfP - ‘Our Interlocked Universe’: Sociohistorical Network Analysis; Methods, Applications, and New Directions



University of Southampton, 26-27th March 2024
Keynote Speaker: Prof. Ruth Ahnert, Queen Mary University of London
In his canonical book, Linked, Albert-László Barabási explored the history and prevalence of networks in the world, and how studying them opens new avenues of understanding, predicting that “network thinking is poised to invade all domains of human activity and most fields of human inquiry… aimed at approaching our interlocked universe.” Often influenced by methodologies from the social sciences, this ‘network thinking’ and an interest in the use of digital and computational tools within the humanities continues to flourish. More recently, t…</p>

Motivation and Goals
Interoperability is a crucial feature for the exchange and utilisation of data. CLARIN promotes interoperability by endorsing the adoption of open science standards. There is, however, a more intuitive notion of interoperability that involves language resources: be they corpora or lexicons, language resources are all made of a basic ingredient, i.e. words. Interoperable content should embed the information that the same lexical item is used across different resources.
The main goal of L2L is to experiment with this idea to connect resources available in CLARIN’s

        <p>Academic Title: 


Associate Director of Instructional Design, Arts and Sciences Online Learning, University of Pennsylvania
 




Dr. Clayton Colmon is the associate director of instructional design for the Arts and Sciences Online Learning team at Penn. In this role, he works with instructors to conceptualize, create, and support educational experiences. Clay believes lifelong learning is integral to any sustainable social system and appreciates the transformative potential of blended and online learning modalities. He is an advocate for inclusivity in present and future knowledge-building communities and uses inclusive design practices in his work. Clay also adapts his instructional design approach to meet individual pedagogical needs.
Before coming to Penn, Clay has taught courses on digital rhetoric, American literature, and science fiction at the University of Delaware. He received his Bachelor of Arts in English and political science, with honors, from Rutgers University. He holds a PhD in English from the University of Delaware. Clay’s work lives at the intersection of critical race, gender, queer, and utopian studies, as he examines technology’s impact on queer communities of color, creative knowledge-work, and social change. He has presented and published scholarship on queer afrofuturism, digital pedagogy, dystopic urban spaces, and critical worldbuilding.

        <p>Die Schueberfouer ist der größte Jahrmarkt in Luxemburg, der alljährlich gegen Ende des Sommers auf dem Glacis Feld in der Hauptstadt stattfindet. In Luxemburg haben zahlreiche Menschen persönliche Erinnerungen an Besuche und Erlebnisse auf diesem Jahrmarkt, und es wird vielfach über seine historische Bedeutung geschrieben, dessen Ursprünge bis ins Jahr 1340 zurückreichen.
Eine interdisziplinäre Studie im Rahmen des Popkult60-Projekts, will die Geschichte der Schueberfouer in den langen 1960er vertiefen und die nationalen, transregionalen und transnationalen Verflechtungen und die Veränderungen dieser populären Veranstaltung aufzeigen.
Während ihres Vortrags wird die Doktorandin Véronique Faber den Ansatz ihrer Forschungsarbeit erläutern, und das Publikum in die 1960er Jahre einladen, eine Schueberfouer zu besuchen, die mit anderen Attraktionen aufwartete als diejenigen, die uns heute vertraut sind.

The Harvester is a Python package that can be used as either a library or a command-line tool. It’s been around in some form for more than 10 years. The latest updates include:
support for version 3 of the Trove API
automatic creation of a metadata file describing each harvest according to the RO-Crate format

        <p>There are a number of different ways to run the Jupyter notebooks in the GLAM Workbench depending on your needs and technical skills. But the easiest and quickest has always been the public, international Binder service, based in Europe. One click in the GLAM Workbench and Binder prepares a customised computing environment and loads up the Jupyter notebooks ready for you to explore. Unfortunately, the public Binder service has been having some capacity issues in the last few months, and sometimes repositories fail to run. The good news is that Australian university researchers now have another option with the launch of the Australian Research Data Commons Binder service!

        <p>I’ve just updated the Trove Query Parser to work with version 3 of the Trove API. You just give it the url of a search in Trove’s newspapers, and it translates the search into a set of parameters that the API will understand. So this:
parse_query(&quot;https://trove.nla.gov.au/search/category/newspapers?keyword&#x3D;wragge&amp;l-artType&#x3D;newspapers&amp;l-state&#x3D;Queensland&amp;l-category&#x3D;Article&amp;l-illustrationType&#x3D;Cartoon&quot;, 3)
Produces this:
{&#x27;q&#x27;: &#x27;wragge&#x27;, &#x27;l-artType&#x27;: &#x27;newspapers&#x27;, &#x27;l-state&#x27;: [&#x27;Queensland&#x27;], &#x27;l-category&#x27;: [&#x27;Article&#x27;], &#x27;l-illustrated&#x27;: &#x27;true&#x27;, &#x27;l-illtype&#x27;: [&#x27;Cartoon&#x27;], &#x27;category&#x27;: &#x27;newspaper&#x27;}
You can then feed the parameters to the Trove API with your API key and you’ll get data back. Easy! It’s simple but handy – I use the Query Parser in other tools like the Trove Newspaper Harvester and QueryPic.
This version adds a second parameter to the parse_query() function so you can specify the version of the Trove API you’re using. The default value is 2 for backwards compatibility. See the documentation for more information.</p>

        <p>The period between the occupation of Luxembourg by Nazi Germany on 10 May 1940 and the beginning of the first deportation train to the East on 16 October 1941, marked by the constantly tightening net of Nazi persecution, was characterized by waves of escape movements of Jewish people leaving the Grand-Duchy. While many initially sought refuge in France, a minority was able to emigrate via neutral countries such as Spain or Portugal to safe havens like the USA.
In parallel with the examination of the fleeing population itself, the strategies it employs, as well as the geographic framework of the escape routes, the thesis investigates the influence of potential aid networks that impacted the flight marked by multiple motivations.
In addition to displaying the initial findings of the research, the presentation will also address the particular challenges regarding the transnational perspective and the micro historical character of the work as individual fates will particularly be woven into the discussion, as well as the connections to the project of the Mémorial de la Shoah au Luxembourg.

GLAM Name Index Search
This is the biggie (in more ways than one). I’ve brought 263 datasets from 10 Australian GLAM organisations together into a single search interface. All these datasets index collections by people’s names, so with one search you can find information about individuals across a broad range of records, locations, and periods. There’s more than 10 million rows of data to explore!

This presentation focuses on the question ‘what is tracking’ through a comprehensive overview of what Software Development Kit (SDKs) are and why these technical objects are relevant to platform power. The aim is to examine the relationship between personal data capture and platform monopolisation through a socio-technical overview of how datafication works in our apps.  SDKs are important tools used by developers to make apps work and to capitalise on their users. The average person has more than 40 different apps on their phone and each app uses an average of 18 SDKs which gather, share, and process our data. Users have little access to or understanding of this core technical data hub or of how…</p>

        <p>In early June I pinned a “nobody’s home” post to my profile and said goodbye to Twitter. After 15 years, I was sad to leave behind friends and colleagues, but glad to get away from the hate, the nazis, and the transphobes. I hadn’t been posting much since Elno took over anyway, and was happily building a new network over on Mastodon. This morning I finally removed the Twitter links from my home page. Bye bye birdsite.
If you want to find me now I’m @wragge@hcommons.social. If you’re still wondering about making the move to Mastodon, I can heartily recommend hcommons.social as a friendly, well run instance. They also have a really useful guide to Mastodon for humanities scholars.</p>

        <p>This talk explores the way Rockstar Games has been mediating American history for the last two decades. It also surveys the way the company deployed a range of paratextual promotional materials to sell games like Red Dead Redemption and L.A. Noire – and specifically, to sell their “authenticity”. The talk notes the importance of incorporating games into our conceptualisation of “digital history,” as well as the need to consider born-digital paratexts materials in our analyses of historical video games.
Esther Wright is Lecturer in Digital History at Cardiff University (Wales, UK), where she researches and teaches historical video games. She is the author of Rockstar Games and American History: Promotional Materials and the Construction of Authenticity (De Gruyter, 2022), and co-editor (with John Wills) of Red Dead Redemption: History, Myth and Violence in the Video Games West (University of Oklahoma Press, 2023). She is also co-convenor of the Historical Games Network, a space for conversation and collaboration between academics, game makers, and cultural heritage professionals.

Provost&#x27;s Postdoctoral Fellow, Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania



A scholar of contemporary fiction, media, and feminist science and technology studies, Arthur Z. Wang studies how scientific concepts travel across contexts and assert universal applicability.
 
His current book project, Minor Theories of Everything, is an interdisciplinary inquiry into the proliferation of scientific universalisms about human sociality since the 20th century, and their surprising uptake by feminists and writers of color. His second book project, tentatively titled Making Scientific Lives, investigates the co-formation of biographical media and the modern sciences, tracing tensions between ideals of scientific impersonality and the vibrant circulation of scientists’ life stories in academic and popular cultures.
 
He received a Ph.D. in English from Yale University and before graduate school, worked as a software engineer. With Annie McClanahan, he co-edits the open-access peer-reviewed journal  Post45.

Gavriel Cutipa-Zorn is a postdoctoral fellow at the Perry World House. His research explores the imperial histories of surveillance and agribusiness throughout the twentieth century. His current book project, Networks of Empire: US and Israeli Technologies of Counterinsurgency, argues that US efforts to subcontract the control of movement of people in Palestine and Latin America shaped municipal policing and data surveillance of agricultural land in the United States. His writing has been published in Cultural Dynamics, Review of International Studies, and Space and Society. He received his PhD in American Studies from Yale University and his BA in History and Africana Studies from Brown University.

        <p>The Closing the Gap in non-Latin script data aims at mapping the field of digital humanities projects outside and beyond the anglosphere with a particular focus on non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese in both machine-actionable and human readable form. The urgency and value of such a survey has been highlighted in recent discussions around global, decolonial, and multilingual digital humanities.</p>

        <p>The NFDI consortium Text+, the DFG priority program Computational Literary Studies, and the EU project CLS-Infra have jointly created a survey on criteria for the creation of literary text corpora or collections. It takes about only 10 minutes to complete: https://survey.academiccloud.de/index.php/916873?lang&#x3D;en

The aim of this survey is to ask researchers who create (digital) literary corpora or collections what information they need and consider for compilation.
Currently, catalogs from libraries, archives, and digital platforms do not yet meet researchers’ criteria because of different priorities regarding metadata.
We want to change this and therefore ask the researchers themselves, for example, whether they are only looking for novels by 19th century French women authors for their corpus or rather what other information besides genre, gender and time period might be important.
Of course, this does not mean that these metadata can be added right after the analysis of the responses to the survey, but prioritization helps us to improve research infrastructures and the supply of digital corpora plus metadata.
Take the first step with us and participate in the survey!

        <p>Way back in 2012, I used the brand new Trove API to download the details of 4 million  articles published on the front pages of newspapers. I did it for two reasons: first, I wanted to see how the content of front pages changed over time; and second, I wanted to show that large-scale data wrangling was entirely possible using nothing more than a laptop and a home broadband connection. I described my adventures in this blog post, but if you look at it now you’ll see lots of sad, empty boxes where live charts used to be. This is because I shared my results though a custom web application which, 10 years later, seems like a really, really dumb idea. Needless to say the app fell foul of web hosting changes and is no more. Nowadays I use GitHub and Jupyter notebooks to share my data noodling, s…</p>

        <p>CLARIN Workshop at Corpus Linguistics 2023 Conference

            
Written by Paul Rayson 
 
On Sunday 2nd July 2023, CLARIN members hosted an in-person workshop titled ‘What can you do with the CLARIN research infrastructure?’. This took place on the day before the Corpus Linguistics (CL2023) conference began at Lancaster University (UK). The workshop focused on practical issues in terms of how corpus linguists can benefit from the CLARIN network and infrastructure. It was organised by Darja Fišer, Francesca Frontini, Paul Rayson and Martin Wynne, and included a special preview session on ParlaMint, presented by Dario Del Fante. The workshop attracted 25 participants.

        <p>WWII Paris and the Shoah


Project Start Date: 

August, 2023



The project of this website was created for an undergraduate advanced French history and culture course entitled Paris under the German Occupation and its [Non-] Places of Memory. The French title is a play on the words « lieu de mémoire » (place of memory) and « un non-lieu » (a dismissed case). The first questions I was faced with when putting the syllabus together were: How could students of French, from an American university, understand a past neither of us lived? And how to expect students – some of whom have never been to Paris - to envision the city under the German Occupation without even knowing its space?

Penn Presidential Compact Professor of Media Studies and the History of Art 



Shannon Mattern is the Penn Presidential Compact Professor of Media Studies and the History of Art at the University of Pennsylvania. Her dad owned a hardware store and makes beautiful furniture, and her mom was a special education teacher. Before coming to Penn, between 2004 and 2022, she worked in the School of Media Studies and the Department of Anthropology at The New School and collaborated regularly with the Parsons School of Design. She won The New School’s Distinguished University Teaching Award. 
Her writing and teaching focus on archives, libraries, and other media spaces; media infrastructures; sites where data intersect with art and design; and media that shape our sensory experiences. She is the author of The New Downtown Library: Designing with Communities; Deep Mapping the Media City; Code and Clay, Data and Dirt: 5000 Years of Urban Media, all published by University of Minnesota Press; and A City Is Not a Computer, published by Princeton University Press. She also contributes a regular long-form column about urban data and mediated infrastructures to Places Journal. In addition, she serves as president of the board of the Metropolitan New York Library Council and regularly collaborates on public design and interactive projects and exhibitions.
She’s currently working on research and creative projects that examine how furniture design structures our engagement with media and our performance of intellectual labor; how trees have supplied both raw material and conceptual models for our media and computational technologies; and how we might creatively reimagine various genres of didactic or bureaucratic media — from field guides and repair manuals to slide decks and toolkits.

Ph.D. Candidate, Italian Studies



Lourdes Contreras’ academic interest encompass the themes of exile, displacement, temporality, rootedness and ecological representations in literature. Her interest in displacement and rootedness stem from the presence of the root metaphor in Italian literature from the fifteenth century to the contemporary period and the implications that this metaphor has on broader political and theoretical issues. Her research in these subjects investigates connections in both Ecocriticism, Mediterranean Studies, and Ecofeminism through authors such as Fausta Cialente, Grazia Deledda, Gianna Manzini, and Alba de Céspedes, among others. She is interested in the theme of rootedness and its significance in contemporary women-written novels.

Ph.D. Candidate, English



Peter Diamond is a PhD candidate in English at University of Pennsylvania, studying seventeenth- and eighteenth-century literature of the Atlantic World. His research interests include Anglophone literature from about 1637–1837, poetry and poetics, political theory, economic history, transatlantic and early American studies, empire, pastoral and georgic traditions, environmental humanities, Biblical exegesis, and the history of material texts. 
Since December 2022, Peter has been a project manager for the Digital Beehive, a project dedicated to digitizing an early eighteenth-century commonplace book from Philadelphia, which is supported by the McNeil Center for Early American Studies; the Price Lab for Digital Humanities; and the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts.
Peter received his M.A. in English from Penn in 2021 as the 2020–2021 John Louis Haney Graduate Fellow. From fall 2021–spring 2023, Peter served as a co-coordinator of the Restoration to Victorian Studies Reading Group (ResVic) in Penn English. He is also a Graduate Resident Advisor at Lauder College House, and he has assisted with the teaching of Penn courses in English, psychoanalytic studies, and cinema and media studies.
Before coming to Penn, Peter received his B.A. in 2020 from Brandeis University, where he graduated summa cum laude with the highest honors in English. At Brandeis, he was a recipient of the Provost&#x27;s Undergraduate Research Fellowship, the Jerome A. Schiff Undergraduate Fellowship, and the Shalom Award for Undergraduate Research.

        <p>Workflows for Semantic Change Research with CLARIN Resource Families

            
 
Written by Barbara McGillivray
Project Overview
This project was supported by CLARIN via the CLARIN Resource Families funding scheme and ran from November 2022 to June 2023. The project team consisted of Barbara McGillivray (King’s College London) and Fahad Khan (CNR-ILC) as project leads, and Paola Marongiu (University of Neuchâtel) as researcher. The project aimed to define workflows for semantic change research with CLARIN Resource Families (CRF), bringing together existing resources and tools needed to support research in lexical semantic change (LSC), which is the linguistic phenomenon in which words change their meanings over time.
  
The concept of the workflows was aligned with the CLARIN 2021-2023…</p>

Many audio and video interviews are long and unstructured, and not easily usable as research data. A team from CLARIN’s Czech node has developed a state-of-the-art system that uses speech recognition and other natural language processing technologies designed specifically for oral history archives.
Called ‘Semantic Search – Asking Questions’, this new machine learning technology enables users to easily access oral history archives and engage with them in an intuitive and interactive way. The technology makes it possible to navigate long sequences of oral recordings by providing pre-generated, time-stamped questions that guide users through the content. In addition, a specialised search function enables direct interaction with the content in the video.

        <p>Op dësem Forum Z diskutéieren mer iwwert wat et op der Schueberfouer an den 1960er ze gesinn an ze di gouf. Wat war deemools populär? Wat hunn d‘Leit giess? Wéi war et fir d‘Lampertsbierger Kanner esou no bei der Fouer ze wunnen? Wéi war et fir Forainskanner op der Fouer hir Vakanz ze verbréngen? Wat huet d’Stad Lëtzebuerg mat der Fouer ze dinn? An nach vill méi kënnt der an engem entspaante Kader lauschtere kommen a mat diskutéieren.
Den Theema vun dësem Forum Z baséiert op enger Dokteraarbecht iwwer déi national, transregional an transnational Verflechtungen um Beispill vun der Schueberfouer vu 1945 bis 1975 a wéi sech dës Verflechtungen an dësem Zäitraum verännert hunn.

        <p>The Trove API Console provides examples of the Trove API in action that you can run, edit, and share. It’s been online for 9 years now, and I’ve just updated it to use version 3 of the Trove API by default. I’ve also added a new ‘Share’ button that makes it easier to share and embed examples.
If you click on the ‘Share’ button, a box will pop up.

If you add a comment, this will appear above the example query when users follow the shared link. You can use this to provide them with some context or a description.

There are two buttons providing different share options:
Copy share url – copies the full url to the shared example
Copy Markdown button – copies a Markdown snippet that embeds a button like this  linked to your example. Just paste it into your Markdown-formatted documentation!
Other improvements include:
The parameters used in any request are now displayed in a table for easy reference.
The Console includes a link to an API Status page. This page runs all the example queries in the Console and checks the results to make sure the API is working as expected. It’s updated every 6 hours.
Version 3 of the Trove API includes a standard Swagger UI that you can use to build queries, and provides limited anonymous access (without the need for an API key). But if, like me, you learn best by looking at examples, then you should find the API Console handy. In particular, the API Console makes it easy to share live examples which can be very useful in training, troubleshooting, and writing documentation. The Trove Data Guide, which I’m working on at the moment, includes lots of ‘Try it!’ buttons.</p>

#CfP International workshop on CLASSICAL TEXTS IN DIGITAL MEDIA, University of Patras (Greece) 



We are delighted to announce an international workshop on “CLASSICAL TEXTS IN DIGITAL MEDIA”, which will take place at the University of Patras (Greece) on 1-3 Sept. 2023 (room II-9, Conference and Cultural Centre). The event will be live-streamed (connect via https://zoom.us/join - meeting ID: 980 8170 8162 - passcode: 525286) and anyone interested is welcome to join.
This workshop will bring together leading researchers and research groups in digital Classics, with the twofold aim of: (i) showcasing and sharing knowledge of the latest developments in working with digitised Greek and Latin texts and related materials; and (ii) identifying hindrances to / limitations of this work, with a view to establishing possible ways forward. At the same time, there will be a round-table discussion with Classics&#x27; publishers on the prospects and challenges of digital and open-access publications in the field.
The event is hosted by the Greek Tragedians Online project (https://eadh.org/projects/greek-fgramentary-tragedians-online-fragtrag1), with funding from the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (ELIDEK). It is also endorsed by the following organisations: U. of Ioannina Institute of Digital Innovation, Brepols, Brill, Cambridge University Press, De Gruyter, Hellenic National Documentation Centre.

        <p>The ARDC has started work on the development of a HASS Community Data Lab to support digital research in the humanities. I’m part of the team of contractors, and my work package is focused on the development of a Trove Data Guide. My aim is to give researchers what they need to use and understand all the varieties of data that Trove makes available – from newspaper text to digitised, high-resolution maps.
I’ve started sketching out the contents and approach in a series of GitHub issues. Comments and suggestions are welcome. The Guide will be built from a collection of Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Book. You can get an idea of how this works from the development site (Warning! Will change often!).
I’m working to get the Guide finished by December. I’ll be sharing my progress here and on Mastodon, so follow along!</p>

        <p>FerroForum démarre l’été avec un hommage à la « Grenz », haut-lieu de la fête ouvrière pendant les trente glorieuses.
Venez dès 16h pour échanger de bons souvenirs autour d’un « Kaffi, Kippchen an Kuch ». Luciano Pagliarini et son orchestre vous feront danser dans l’atelier central.
S’ensuivra une notturna ferruginosa avec des actions de fer et de feu par l’équipe du FerroForum. Une retroplatinodisco se poursuivra jusque dans la nuit, avec les Loon Djs aux platines. Pour vous restaurer, nous avons prévu des frites et et des bières comme à la frontière. Et si vous voulez vraiment vous (et nous) faire plaisir, venez endimanchés comme aux bals d’antan! T’ass Feierowend!
Feierowend! est l’opportunité de vous présenter un projet de livre, fruit d’une collaboration entre le FerroForum et Laura Steil, chercheuse au C²DH (Université du Luxembourg). Dans le cadre du projet Popkult60 (FNR/DFG), elle s’intéresse à la fête, la danse et la musique dans le Luxembourg sidérurgique des années 1950-70.
En tant que second ouvrage publié par le FerroForum, “Feieren: Fester, Musék an Danz am Minett” mettra l’accent sur la culture et la mémoire des bals, danses et musiques populaires dans le sud du Luxembourg. Nous continuons de collecter des témoignages et des documents, contactez-nous si vous voulez contribuer!

        <p>Join us online for this international conference on the long history of public historical practices in Europe organised by the Public History as new Citizen Science of the Past (PHACS) project. For two days, presenters will explore the variety of historical practices that engaged with the public. From Herodotus and Thucydides in Classical Greece to the Mass Observation Archives in mid-20th century England, with focuses on historical societies, street naming or commemorations in the 19th century, the range of case studies demonstrates the breadth of the field and the long-standing history of what later developed as public history.

        <p>As a result of the digital revolution and the new possibilities for communication and documentation, Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine is already considered the best-documented war to date. How should this be assessed, however, from the perspective of digital humanities? What does this mean for the concept of digital source criticism in times of fragile facts? What form of digital agency can be observed and what does this mean for the status of classical historical research and curatorial activities taken care of by institutions? The presentation develops four hypotheses on the manifold implications of the current war for the future of digital history. It also addresses ethical challenges for research and asks how a decolonization of Russian/Soviet history and the demand for a recentering of Ukraine in the European understanding of history can be met in the field of digital humanities.

        <p>New Impact Story: Gender in Poland’s Presidential Election Campaigns

            

  
  
            
    


      

At a time when Poland is grappling with a conservative push and growing polarisation among its population, political scientists Agata Włodkowska and Joanna Gajda reconstructed and analysed how the notions of sex and gender featured in the 2015 and 2020 Polish presidential election campaigns. Using the CLARIN-PL tools Korpusomat and ComCorp, the researchers analysed the language used by the presidential candidates, as well as the presence of gender-related topics in their election agendas, showing the impact that vocabulary and dominant themes can have during the election process itself, as well as their importance for gender equality more broadly.

        <p>No dem 2. Weltkrich huet sech d’Schueberfouer ëmmer méi zu engem grousse populäre Fest entwéckelt. Et gouf verschidde Schaubude mat Zauberkënschtler, Boxkämpfer, ëmmer méi schnellen Attraktiounen, e Goldfësch ze gewannen a Fritten am Pabeiercornet. An dësem Workshop wëlle mir mat Hëllef vu Fotoen illustréiere wéi et an den 1960er Joren op der Schueberfouer war. Wéi eng Attraktiounen a Schaubude gouf et? Wat waren d‘Geräischer an d’Gerécher? Wat huet ee giess? Zesumme wëlle mer eis dorun erënneren an d’Ënnerscheeder zu haut diskutéieren. D’Participante kënnen och hir Erënnerungen zum Schluss ophuelen. Dëse Workshop gëtt organiséiert am Kader vun enger Dokteraarbecht iwwer d’Schueberfouer um C²DH op der Universitéit Lëtzebuerg.
Gesicht gëtt virun allem no Läit déi an den 1960er Joer d’Schueberfouer besicht hunn an hier Erënnerung wëllen deelen.

Laura Brennan will present her project Forgetting the Freed: The Buried Histories of Chimborazo Park in Richmond, Virginia, United States. Laura’s project is a place-based history of a public park in Richmond, Virginia, a major city in the Southern region of the United States. The site once hosted a Confederate hospital during the American Civil War and a postwar neighborhood for newly freed African Americans before it became a modern city park that today includes a Confederate history museum. The presentation will focus on the site’s historical transition from the postwar Black neighborhood to the all-White park, and examine how the radical Black history of the site was obscured and “forgotten” over time in different ways.

        <p>The NSW State Archives (now part of Museums of History NSW) publishes a series of useful indexes to its collections. The indexes include basic data transcribed from the records, such as names, dates, and places, providing fine-grained access to the collections. But when they’re explored as data, the indexes also suggest new ways of analysing, visualising, and linking sets of records. (For some of the possibilities and challenges of using this sort of data see Missing Links: Data Stories from the Archive of British Settler Colonial Citizenship).
In 2016, I started harvesting the index data from the NSW State Archives website to make each dataset available as an easily downloadable CSV file. In 2019, changes to the website made it impossible to access the complete indexes, so I was unable to…</p>

        <p>Introducing a New CLARIN Resource Family: Corpus Query Tools

            


Written by Martin Wynne, Lancaster University, recipient of the CLARIN Resource Families Project Funding initiative.
The CLARIN Resource Families (CRF) provide user-friendly overviews of available language resources in the CLARIN infrastructure for researchers from the digital humanities, social sciences and human language technologies. Many CRF are datasets of various types, but an increasing number now focus on software applications and tools.
 
The new Corpus Query Resource Family is for software applications which allow searching, exploring, analysing and visualising linguistic corpora and texts. Text and corpus analysis lie at the heart of digital scholarship in the humanities and social sciences, and a wide range of software tools are available in this domain. These software tools represent prime examples of the ways in which language technologies can support research across a range of disciplines, and they are therefore central to CLARIN’s mission.
 
The Corpus Query Resource Family includes both applications for installation on the users&#x27; own computer (desktop) and those accessible via a web browser (online), with some key information to help users to find them and choose the appropriate tool for their particular research goal. Corpus Query Tools are defined here as ones that allow the user to search and explore a text or corpus, and can produce concordances, wordlists and other means of understanding the the texts, such as concordances, clusters and keywords.
 
Resource Families include all tools in this domain which are useful to researchers (not only &#x27;CLARIN tools&#x27;), so please get in touch if your favourite software application or online interface is not yet included. For comments, changes or additions, please email resource-families@clarin.eu.

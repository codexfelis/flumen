        <p>The C²DH is hosting the international conference &quot;Historical arguments and the Digital&quot; from 25 to 27 June on the university campus in Belval.
In 2016, Franco Morretti argued that “somehow digital humanities has managed to secure for itself this endless infancy, in which it is always a future promise.”1 In the years since, little has changed. Whilst there has been exponential growth in the number of resources, tools, and methodological discussions in the digital humanities, there remains limited contribution towards traditional historical narratives implementing these, increasing the apparent gap between DH and traditional history. Terminology in the digital humanities – networks, mapping, modelling – has long been used metaphorically to explore historical phenomenon; yet in digitalizing t…</p>

Course encourages students to grapple with AI’s implications



The world was collectively agog as Open AI recently unveiled its new artificial intelligence video tool, Sora. Users shared colorful 3D animations and pirate ships floating on mahogany waves of coffee. A few days later, Sora was old news and Groq, an AI language tool, claimed global headlines for lightning-fast capabilities that leave ChatGPT in the proverbial dust.
And in a University of Nebraska–Lincoln classroom, Adrian Wisnicki quickly tweaked plans to incorporate these developments into class discussions — something he does often. Using cutting-edge AI tools, literature and contemporary films and articles, Wisnicki encourages students to grapple with questions related to AI and technology in the course…</p>

        <p>L’influence des médias et la désinformation sont parmi les questions vives de nos sociétés contemporaines. Les reconfigurations des espaces médiatiques, notamment en ligne, conduisent à de nouvelles offres et de nouveaux usages de l’information. Le «cycle de rencontres sur l’influence des médias et la désinformation» organisé dans la Grande Région est une action culturelle qui souhaite participer à stimuler le regard critique des citoyens sur l’actualité.
Entre 2024 et 2026, l’Université de Lorraine et l’Université du Luxembourg proposeront 6 conférences en Lorraine et au Luxembourg avec un.e chercheur.e en SHS, un.e journaliste et un.e animateur.rice spécialiste du sujet. Chaque conférence traitera d’un angle différent de l’influence des médias.

        <p>In 2005 the Guinness Brewery at Park Royal, West London closed after seven decades of production. The author spent the last six months of the Brewery’s life working with a photographer to record in words and picture the site before closure. Subsequent research carried out over a twelve-year period revealed an incredibly rich story of corporate culture change, the transformation of work and the workplace as well as deindustrialisation. His research included working in archives in Dublin, Scotland and London as well as oral histories and an extensive range of visual methods. Drawing on material from his book based on the project, Voices of Guinness: An Oral History of the Park Royal Brewery, Oxford 2019, the author reflects on what that story tells us about work meaning, identity and organis…</p>

        <p>The GLAM Workbench has a brand new section aimed at helping you find and use government publications in Trove. Most of the GLAM Workbench’s existing sections focus on a particular resource format, or are related to one of Trove’s top-level categories. This didn’t quite work for government publications, as things like Parliamentary Papers are spread across multiple categories, and can encompass a variety of formats. So I thought a new section was the best way of bringing it all together.
At the moment the Trove Government section includes two notebooks and three pre-harvested datasets.

        <p>Artificial intelligence, particularly in the form of large language models, has been at the forefront of news for several years. The majority of historians, when they express an opinion on the matter, seem mainly concerned about whether their students will be able to have essays composed by an electronic servant, and if so, to whom the obtained grade should be attributed. It is true that sometimes one looks at the finger pointing towards the star and not at the moon itself. Indeed, it seems that the impact is not so much of the invention, but of the accessibility of these devices that could be significant. The acquisition of historical data, its manipulation, as well as its interpretation are expected to take place within a workshop, with deeply renewed tools. The collapse of the cost of data acquisition and manipulation opens up multiple possibilities, among which are the potential for data-driven research, the manipulation of corpora of unprecedented size, and, paradoxically, a distancing from the text, the basic element of the historian&#x27;s diet since the origins of the discipline. We will explore these potentialities through a few examples.

        <p>Die DHd2022 war aus vielerlei Gründen ein erinnerungswürdiges Ereignis. Ursprünglich für 2021 geplant, dann verschoben und als Hybridkonferenz konzipiert und letztendlich als reines Online-Event umgesetzt, war sie mit über 1.000 angemeldeten Teilnehmer*innen die bisher größte DHd-Konferenz aller Zeiten. In der vorletzten Folge unserer Konferenzrückblick-Reihe sprechen wir mit Anna Busch und Ulrike Wuttke über die Herausforderungen […]

          <h3>Deindustrialisation and its Impact on Luxembourg&#x27;s Industrial Cities, 1970-1990<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

          Reading time: 2 minutes </p>
        <p>Since the 1970s, deindustrialisation has fundamentally changed Luxembourg’s economy, shifting its focus from industry to services. Beyond these major structural changes, the restructuring of the steel industry has had important consequences at the local level, both for workers and for industrial towns. This research focuses on the impact of deindustrialisation in three industrial towns in Luxembourg, Esch, Dudelange and Pétange, and aims to explore local challenges and initiatives in response to the restructuring of the steel industry.
The closure of blast furnaces and rolling mills triggered intense debates in the town councils of Luxembourg&#x27;s steel towns, focusing on issues such as the town budget and overall viability. Industrial decline was seen as a potential &#x27;death blow&#x27; for the existence of the towns, leading various stakeholders, including workers, shop owners, trade unionists and politicians, to rally against the closure of the local blast furnace. A key area of interest in the research are the local strategies implemented to address the challenges of deindustrialisation and the decisions taken by the steel companies ARBED and MMR-A and the Tripartite Conference. Although the focus of the research is on the cities, the national and European levels are also taken into account, as local actions extended beyond city boundaries.

        <p>The exhibition Minett Stories tells the history of the industrial region in the south of Luxembourg. Instead of focusing on the mining and smelting technologies, large iron works and steel barons, the project team decided to present the everyday history of an industrial region, concentrating on the time span from the industrialization of the region in around 1870 to the steel crisis of the 1970s. The online exhibition embraced the concept of transmedia storytelling for the production of narratives and media: the team worked in collaboration with several artists, stage actors and designers to produce graphic novels, interactive videos and maps, radio plays and video essays. The presentation will cover several examples to highlight this approach, before reflecting on the project as part of t…</p>

        <p>This year the annual conference of the Australian Historical Association will include a digital history stream, sponsored by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), and convened by me!
The call for papers is available here or through the Conference website. The list of possible topics is deliberately broad and inclusive – if you’re using digital tools or methods in the organisation, analysis, and visualisation of historical data we’d love to hear from you. Proposals are due on 23 February and can be submitted through the Conference website.

We’re particularly keen for HDR and ECR scholars to be involved. To help meet registration and travel costs, the ARDC is funding up to four $1000 bursaries. More details are available here. Bursary applications close on 31 March.
There’s also likely to be a digital history workshop, as well as updates on the work of the HASS &amp; Indigenous Research Data Commons and ARDC Community Data Lab, including the Trove Data Guide.
Time is short! Get your proposals in now! Contact me at tim@timsherratt.au if you have any questions.</p>

        <p>CLARIN is Joining Horizon Europe OSCARS Project

            

  
  
            
  


      

 
The five ‘Science Clusters’, which in the past four years worked together on funded projects under the Horizon 2020 programme, have now embarked on a new project: Horizon Europe OSCARS. The ambitious project, which aims to foster the uptake of Open Science in Europe by developing long-term interdisciplinary FAIR data services and working practices, will take place over the next four years. 
Many world-class European research infrastructures (RIs) are organised into one of the five major Science Clusters (Humanities and Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Photon and Neutron Science, Astronomy, Nuclear and Particle Physics). In the past four years, the Science Clusters have worked towards making open data easily accessible to both researchers and the public, by promoting scientific data management for enabling Open Science.
As a result, the five Science Clusters are an integral part of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) initiative and will further contribute to its development and implementation process through their participation in OSCARS.
CLARIN is proud to be participating in OSCARS as part of the SSHOC cluster. CLARIN is one of three research infrastructures from the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) area to represent the Cluster, together with DARIAH ERIC and CESSDA. Our involvement ensures that the SSH community is included in the project’s developments.   
To maintain the high momentum achieved during the Horizon 2020 programme, OSCARS has been granted ~25M EUR funding in the framework of the European Commission Horizon Europe call HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-01, under grant agreement no. 101129751, and will be implemented in the next four years.
For more information, visit the OSCARS project page.

        <p>As you read these lines, the Amazons Rainforest keeps on burning. During the month of August 2018, the news spread fast over social media platforms. Hashtags such as #wildfires #AmazonFires #SaveTheAmazons made their trends for not more than seven days. Other trends rapidly covered #AmazonFires trends. Approximately one million hectares of high biodiversity forests have been burned so far since the #AmazonFires started. Almost 20% of the Amazon rainforest has been devastated. Reports from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) show that in the first seven months of 2019, the deforestation rate in the Brazilian Amazon increased by 278%. Experts estimate that it would take 200 years for those forests to regenerate.
The Amazon is the largest and most diverse Rainforest in the world.…</p>

If you have a text written in a language that you don’t understand, then you would require a translation of it. If you have a text  in a language that you are technically […]

        <p>What we call “technology” today involves intensely concentrated metabolic processes, ingesting and transforming energy and materials on a planetary scale. Techno-metabolism also concentrates and compresses time. Its temporalities include Earth&#x27;s deep past (fossil fuels, minerals) and its present (biological net primary production). The Anthropocene epoch – with humanity as a new geological force – now appears likely to consume, as well, the human future, potentially to the extinction of our species. Holding multiple temporal and spatial scales within our analytic frameworks has proven (unsurprisingly) difficult for STS and History of Technology. This talk offers ways of reconfiguring our conceptual and methodological tools to meet this urgent challenge.

        <p>Since July 2022 I’ve been generating weekly snapshots of the contents of the Trove newspaper corpus. Every Sunday a new version of the Trove Newspaper Data Dashboard is created, highlighting what’s changed over the previous week, and visualising trends since April 2022 (when I first started regular data harvests).

All of the past versions of the dashboard are preserved in GitHub, but there wasn’t an easy way to browse them, until now. If you want to find out what changed in any week since July 2022, you can now visit the Trove Data Dashboard Archive and select a date from the list!
I created the archive by pulling all the versions from GitHub and saving them as individual files. I’ve also added some code to the weekly process that should automatically archive the past week from now on – we’ll see if it works next Sunday…</p>

        <p>As well as tools and code, the GLAM Workbench includes a number of pre-harvested datasets for researchers to play with. But just including a link to a CSV file in GitHub or Zenodo isn’t very useful – it doesn’t help researchers understand what’s in the dataset, and why it might be useful. That’s why I’ve also started including links that open the CSV files in Datasette-Lite, enabling the contents to be searched, filtered, and faceted. Just look for the Explore in Datasette buttons!
Datasette is an excellent tool for sharing and exploring data. I’ve used it in a number of projects such as the GLAM Name Index Search and the Tasmanian Post Office Directories. Datasette-Lite is a version of Datasette that runs completely in the user’s web browser – no need for separate servers! All you do is p…</p>

        <p>The «long» 1960s in Western Europe saw a dynamic development of mass consumption, especially in the field of consumer electronics. Media artifacts, such as transistor radios, television sets, or cassette recorders all became significantly more common in Luxembourg, France, and Germany, influencing the composition of the media ensemble and opening up new ways for consumers to interact with media. In a concomitant development brought about by the new market conditions, companies producing such media artifacts – such as Braun or Telefunken – became increasingly interested in marketing, placing consumers and their desires at the center of their considerations in lieu of production.
Using internal company documents, advertisements and statistics as sources, this research traces how and at what scale producing companies used advertising and other marketing measures to popularize media artifacts in the «long» 1960s and how these efforts interrelated with the media ensemble. This project is part of Popkult60.

Rune was a true humanistic scholar. He studied philology and got his PhD at the University of Bergen in 2001 with a text-critical analysis of Old Norse Kings’ sagas. He also studied theology and published a Norwegian psalm lexicon. In his work as researcher and later senior librarian, he was involved in very many Digital Humanities projects, such as the Wittgenstein Archives at Bergen, the Norwegian Language Collections, the lexicographical projects, and others. He published widely on mediaeval philology, transcription, OCR, 
    
Text Encoding Initiative
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative
Rune became very engaged in CLARIN activities. With others, he gave CLARINO courses on language data management, produced a series of instructional videos on how to use CLARINO data and services, and kept the CLARINO Bergen Centre running. He was co-author of a chapter in the 2022 CLARIN book.
We will miss Rune not only because he was always interested, helpful and dedicated, but also because he did so with a smile and a genuine modesty and friendliness.

        <p>CLARIN and Libraries 2023: A Recap

            

  
  
            
    
In May 2022, the first CLARIN and Libraries took place in the Hague, Netherlands. The aim was to bring together the CLARIN community and national and academic libraries to present and discuss content delivery systems for researchers. The motivation for the workshop was the sense that various, mostly national, projects were disconnected from each other and also disconnected from research infrastructures such as CLARIN. The workshop resulted in a mailing list, blog post, keynote and a panel discussion at the 2022 CLARIN Annual Conference, two poster presentations, the CENL Dialogue Forum ‘National libraries as data’ and, finally, the plan to organise a second iteration of CLARIN and Libraries, to be hosted in Norway.

        <p>The understanding of heritage greatly depends on its broad functions and use. Depending on their roles in specialist knowledge domains and society at large, heritage objects are categorized as either material or immaterial; static or dynamic; historical or contemporary in nature. For example, in societal debates, heritage needs to be fluid, debatable, even contestable, while scientists of the past seek the robustness of historical sources in order to create a valid reconstruction of aspects of the past.
In this workshop, we are not going to make things easier. Approaching the matter from the domain of critical heritage theory, we find that heritage is best understood as an ongoing forging and recasting of relationships. These relations present themselves as connections between present and …</p>

        <p>The hardest part of developing tools and resources like the GLAM Workbench is getting information about them to the people who might benefit. The collapse of Twitter has only added to the difficulty, as has the reluctance of GLAM organisations to share new resources with their users. I’d rather spend my time making new tools, but what’s the point if no-one knows they exist?
Anyway, I thought I’d do a bit of a communications refresh for the new year. If you’re interested in GLAM Workbench and Trove Data Guide updates you can:
Keep an eye on the GLAM Workbench channel of my microblog (or add the feed to your RSS reader)
Follow the GLAM Workbench Facebook page for cross-posted updates from the RSS feed
Follow the GLAM Workbench LinkedIn page for cross-posted updates from the RSS feed
I’m also working on an email newsletter thing that’ll compile the updates at regular intervals.
For more social socials, as well as questions, requests and problems, you can always find me on Mastodon: @wragge@hcommons.social. My email address is not too hard to find, but, honestly, your chances of getting a reply are slim.
If you’ve got a bug report, or a suggestion for a new notebook or data source, feel free to create an issue on GitHub.
And, of course, everything I do is openly-licensed, so you are very welcome to modify and share! See the GLAM Workbench for other ways to get involved.</p>

        <p>The National Library of Australia holds over 55,000 hours of oral history and folklore recordings dating back to the 1950s. This collection is being made available online, and many recordings can now be listened to using Trove’s audio player.
However, the oral history collection is not easy to find in Trove. You need to go the ‘Music, Audio, &amp; Video’ category and check the ‘Sound/Interview, lecture, talk’ format facet. To limit results to oral histories that have been digitised, you can add “nla.obj” to your query and set the ‘Access’ facet to ‘Online’. But what’s actually in the oral history collection and what can you do with it?
To help researchers explore and analyse the NLA’s oral history collection, I’ve added some notebooks to the Music, sound, and oral histories section of the GLAM…</p>

          <h3>Mapping MARC Geographic Area codes to Wikidata<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

        <p>Trove uses codes from the MARC Geographic Areas list to identify locations in metadata records. I couldn’t find any mappings of these codes to other sources of geospatial information, so I fired up OpenRefine and reconciled the geographic area names against Wikidata. Once I’d linked as many as possible, I copied additional information from Wikidata, such as ISO country codes, GeoNames identifiers, and geographic coordinates.
I’ve saved the resulting dataset in two formats – as a flattened CSV file (handy for loading as a dataframe), and as a JSON file that uses the geographic area codes as keys (handy for looking up values). You can download the datasets from this GitHub repository.
I’ve also written the codes back into the Wikidata records, so you can now find them with a SPARQL query like this.
The columns in the CSV file are:
code – MARC geographic areas code (without any trailing dashes)
place – name of geographic area from the MARC list
wikidata_label – name of geographic area from Wikidata
wikidata_id – Wikidata identifier
coordinates – pair of decimal coordinates in the form latitude,longitude (multiple values are pipe | separated)
iso_country_code – ISO two letter country code (multiple values are pipe | separated)
iso_numeric_country_code – ISO numeric country code (multiple values are pipe | separated)
geonames_id – GeoNames identifier (multiple values are pipe | separated)
Note that some fields can contain multiple values. For example the area Mediterranean Region is linked to 22 countries, so there will be multiple values in the ISO code fields.

For an example of this dataset in use, see Which countries do the oral histories relate to? in the Trove Data Guide.</p>

        <p>In 2023 the National Archives of Australia digitised 416,602 files (down from 575,597 in 2022). This chart shows the number of files digitised per day in 2023.

These files were drawn from 1,423 different series, but the vast bulk (81%) were from 4 series of World War Two service records. (This media release includes some details about the funding of the WW2 digitisation.)
Here’s the top twenty series by number of items digitised in 2023.

        <p>I’ve been capturing weekly snapshots of the Trove newspaper corpus for the last couple of years. You can see the latest results in the Trove Newspaper Data Dashboard. Using this data I’ve compiled a quick summary of changes over the last year.
7,518,764  digitised newspaper articles were added to Trove in 2023. The total  number of articles increased from 236,530,127 to 244,048,891. The chart below shows how the number of articles varied across the year. You’ll notice that the rate of digitisation increased about the same  time the government announced new funding for Trove. Were more articles  digitised because of the funding, or were articles in the digitisation  pipeline held back until the funding was announced? Or both?

Most  of the new articles were published in either Victoria or …</p>

Using data from the CLARIN-IS repository, Sigríður Ólafsdóttir and Auður Pálsdóttir, associate professors at the University of Iceland, have created and published a list of Icelandic academic words – the first of its kind in Iceland. The researchers first developed a new corpus, MÍNO, from which a word frequency list of Icelandic vocabulary was created. The texts from the corpus were obtained from two corpora already available in the CLARIN-IS repository, The Icelandic Gigaword Corpus and the Tagged Icelandic Corpus.
Starkaður Barkarson, the National Coordinator for CLARIN-IS, assisted the researchers in creating the new corpus and the frequency list. All the three products, the corpus, the frequency list and the word list, have been uploaded to the CLARIN-IS repository.

        <p>How did newly drawn state border lines after the First World War provoke the establishment and implementation of policies and practices of veteran welfare selection? Different understandings of veteran welfare by historical actors in the French-Luxembourgish-German-Belgian borderlands prompted unique selections of beneficiaries, which resulting in the composition of various (cross-border) mixed welfare systems. This contribution highlights the importance of thinking about bordering practices in tandem with the way time was experienced by veterans and within their environments. 
SOCIOBORD reframes the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by restoring the contributions of local actors – primarily families and associations – to shaping welfare systems in three European borderlands: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions from the late 19th century to the 1990s. SOCIOBORD turns the attention to the co-construction of social assistance by public and private actors in three borderland contexts marked by social, cultural, economic, religious or ethnic diversity.

        <p>As chains of wealth became global in the world economy (Seabroke&amp;Wigan, 2022) so did tax strategies. These topics have gained increased attention in the last fifteen years as the crisis of 2007/2008 renewed the discussion on inequalities and (fiscal) justice. Humanities and Social Sciences played an important role in framing debates on this topic. Wealth was perhaps less produced by manufacturing cars or building houses than by moving capital across jurisdictions, creating multi jurisdictional spaces where national states, global companies, local financial plumbers and international organisations created, maintained and governed global tax chains.
This workshop has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it intends to take stock of these ongoing international and interdisciplinary debates. On the…</p>

The University from Above: Mapping Mexico City with Archival Aerial Imagery  
 
Aerial photography has historically been used as a technology of war, surveillance, and the promotion of large development projects. Despite these original purposes, however, archival aerial imagery and digital mapping methods can also allow us to document historical processes that have been omitted from traditional archival sources. This project applies georectification to aerial imagery of Mexico City to better understand the 1950s campus construction for the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the stories of communities that lived in this region before the campus was built. Visualizing the university from above helps us understand the social landscape of …</p>

        <p>#JobOpening Assistant Professor for Digital Humanities in the Study of Religion – Ruhr University Bochum



The Center for Religious Studies at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, seeks a scholar for an appointment as Assistant Professor (W1, tenure track W2). The future position holder is expected to represent the field of Digital Humanities in the study of religion in research and teaching. In particular, the aim is to further develop research questions of the Digital Humanities in relation to religion and to introduce the methods of the Digital Humanities into religious studies education.
A background in religious studies is not a prerequisite. Given a general interest in getting involved in religion-related collaborative research, applications from people with a background in digital humanities or other humanities, cultural studies or social science subjects are welcome. Due to the interdisciplinary context in Bochum, the professorship offers a particular opportunity to strengthen the area of non-European and/or historical languages in the Digital Humanities and to stimulate the field of #MultilingualDH.
More details about the position and application procedure can be found at https://jobs.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/jobposting/8c4b276c0e75e597169c5082e2051ca7e51870120.</p>

While digital methods are increasingly common in the humanities, the status of &quot;Digital Humanities&quot; has evolved over the years. Once a cutting edge buzzword, DH has grown into a vast umbrella covering a myriad of scholarly activities that can nevertheless be a polarizing concept.
The purpose of this meeting of the Graduate Student Working Group in Digital Humanities is to have a candid discusion about strategies for talking about and represernting digital work in professional contexts including but not limited to job interviews. It should be useful for students who have solid DH expereince but also students who are wondering if their work even counts as digital.
Panelists will be:
Brent Cebul, History
Emily Hammer, Near Eastern Languages and Cultures
Jim English, English
Whitney Trettien, English

Title: From Clusters to Graphs – Toward a Scalable Viewing of News Videos
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines density-based clustering and graph modeling to create a scalable viewing application for the exploration of similarity patterns in news videos. Unlike most existing video analysis tools that focus on individual videos, our approach allows for an overview of a larger collection of videos, which can be further examined based on their connections or communities. By utilizing scalable reading, specific subgraphs can be selected from the overview and their respective clusters can be explored in more detail on the video frame level.

Title: Beyond Canonicity: Modeling Canon/Archive Literary Change in French Fiction
Abstract: This study offers a fresh perspective on the Canon/Archive problem in literature through computational analysis. Following Tynianov’s understanding of literature, we adopt a dynamic approach to literature by proposing a model of literary variability using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We retrieve key authors and works that shape the broad outlines of literary change. Our aim is to evaluate the importance of canonical authors on literary variability. We opt for a cohort-driven setup to analyze the variability contributed by a given text, focusing on specific formal and semantic aspects of texts such as topics, lexicon, characterization, and chronotope. The findings reveal that canonical authors tend to contribute slightly more to literary change than those from the archive.

Title: Unraveling the Synoptic puzzle: stylometric insights into Luke’s potential use of Matthew
Abstract: The literary sources behind the three canonical Synoptic Gospels, namely Luke, Matthew and Mark, have long intrigued scholars because of the Gospels striking similarities and notable differences in their accounts of Jesus’s life. Various theories have been proposed to explain these textual relationships, including common oral witnesses, lost sources or communities possessing each other’s works. However, a universally accepted solution remains elusive. Leveraging advancements in statistics…</p>

Title: Formulas and decision-making: the case of the States General of the Dutch Republic
Abstract: Formulaic expressions are commonly used in administrative texts, and may reflect standardisation of the decision-making process or its recording process.    In this paper we investigate whether the use of formulas in the Resolutions of the Dutch States General (1576-1796) reveal an increase in standardisation.     %    We use stylometric analysis and measures of textual repetition to identify shifts in the use of formulas, and study how the fraction of paragraphs that is covered by formulas changes over time to identify templates consisting of frequent combinations of formulas.   Our findings are that there are stylistically clearly distinguishable periods, and that the use of formulas and templates increases between subsequent periods.

Title: The Middle Dutch Manuscripts Surviving from the Carthusian Monastery of Herne (14th century): Constructing an Open Dataset of Digital Transcriptions
Abstract: A substantial collection of Middle Dutch manuscripts survives from the Carthusian monastery of Herne ( Hérinnes-lez-Enghien ) in nowadays Belgium. During the latter half of the fourteenth century, Herne served as a significant literary hotspot in the region around Brussels, with a devoted community of monks deeply involved in the production of (vernacular) texts and manuscripts, often as collaborative efforts. The corpus offers abundant material for the (computational) exploration of authorship, translation, and scribal cultures in the premodern Low Countries. Yet, much of this material has remained digitally inaccessible.  Here we describe the creation of an almost exhaustive, open-access dataset comprising diplomatic transcriptions of all known Middle Dutch Herne manuscripts, acquired through handwritten text recognition. Apart from rich codicological and textual metadata, we include a normalized text layer (with expanded abbreviations), as well as a linguistic annotation layer (with lemmas and part of speech tags). We conclude by discussing our work against current trends in medievalist scholarship. The dataset is released together with this paper and we encourage its re-use in future research.

Title: A Topological Data Analysis of Navigation Paths within Digital Libraries
Abstract: The digitization of library resources and services have opened up physical informational spaces to new dimensions by allowing users to access a wealth of documents in ways that differ from browsing bookshelves traditionally organized according to the “tree of knowledge”. How do readers of digital library orient themselves within big corpora? What landmarks do they use to navigate masses of digital documents? Taking Gallica as a case study–the digital heritage platform of the French national library–, this paper presents an experimental research on the navigation practices of its users. Using methods from topological data analysis, we inferred from Gallica’s server logs an informational space as it is roamed by readers. Coupled with user interviews, this mixed-methods study allowed us to identify a set of “regimes of navigation” characterizing how readers deploy various strategies to browse the digital library’s corpus. From directed search to wandering to crawling, these regimes answer different needs and show that a single corpus can, in turns, be apprehended as a heritage collection, a database, a set of documents, and a mass of information.

Title: Make Love or War? Monitoring the Thematic Evolution of Medieval French Narratives
Abstract: In this paper, we test a famous conjecture in literary history  put forward by Seignobos and de Rougemont according to which the French central medieval period (12-13th centuries) is characterized by an important increase in the cultural importance of love. To do that, we focus on the large and culturally important body of manuscripts containing medieval French long narrative fictions, in particular epics ( chansons de geste , of the Matter of France) and romances (chiefly  romans  on the Matters of Britain and of Rome), both in verse and in prose, from the 12th to the 15th century. We introduce the largest available corpus of these texts, the  Corpus of Medieval French Epics and Romances , composed of digitised manuscripts drawn from  Gallica , and processed through layout analysis and handwritten text recognition.   %  We then use  semantic representations based on embeddings  to monitor the place given to love and violence in this corpus, through time.  We observe that themes (such as the relation between love and death) and emblematic works well identified by literary history do indeed play a central part in the representation of love in the corpus, but our modelling also points to the characteristic nature of more overlooked works. Variation in time seems to show that there is indeed an phase of expansion of love in these fictions, in the 13th and early 14th century, followed by a period of contraction, that seem to correlate with the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages.

Title: Oscillation between Contemplation and Revelation - Recurrence and Change in the Life History of Teresa of Ávila
Abstract: Advancements in language technology and applied mathematics offer a plethora of tools that can enrich textual cultural heritage research. Using an information-theoretical approach to author profiling, this paper tries to leverage some of these tools to reconstruct mental states in the Early Modern Spanish author Teresa of  &#x27; A vila. We shift away from traditional static textual feature analysis and instead approach author profiling as a dynamic problem, requiring a representation of the author’s life history. Teresa of  &#x27; A vila was an Early Modern Spanish mystic and Carmelite nun whose authorship offers a unique dataset due to her prolific output and well-preserved, digitized writings. We model Teresa’s letter corpus as a complex system with multiple states and try to track her mental and socio-cultural dynamics through lexical co-occurrence structures and affective valences in her letters. We find that Teresa’s letters reflect a life history of state switching between contemplation and revelation. This relatively new approach offers a more robust and dynamic perspective on author profiling in cultural heritage research.

Title: Is Cinema Becoming Less and Less Innovative With Time? Using neural network text embedding model to measure cultural innovation
Abstract: Current discourse reflects a growing skepticism towards contemporary popular culture, specifically the realm of cinema, with an emerging consensus that its creative capacity is on a waning trajectory. This study introduces a novel approach which employs natural language processing techniques and embedding methods to measure semantic novelty of cultural items’ descriptions. We apply this methodology to cinema, analyzing plot summaries of over 19,000 movies from the United-States spanning more than a century. Our measure’s robustness is validated through a series of tests, including a fit with a genre-based novelty score, a manual inspection of films identified as highly innovative, and correlations with award recognitions. The application of our Innovation Score reveals a compelling pattern: an increase in the rate of cinematic innovation throughout the 20th century, followed by a stabilization in the rate of innovation in the 21st, despite an ever-growing production of films. Contrary to the often-voiced lament that cinema is losing its innovative edge, our study suggests that the level of innovativeness in cinema is not in decline.

Title: Towards a Phenomenographic Framework for Exploratory Visual Analysis of Bibliographic Data
Abstract: A recurring challenge when studying history of translation is interpreting catalogue metadata. On one hand such interpretation is limited by the fact that data present in catalogue records is tabular and nominative, and not quantitative. On the other hand, such research is guided by tacit knowledge of scholars in the humanities, and thus it could be challenging to reproduce its results. We take inspiration from phenomenography, a discipline within educational research that examines how students perceive the phenomena being learned. We adopt the view that scientific inquiry is a collective form of learning. By doing this, we turn to the phenomenographic theory that variation is necessary to understand the phenomena being studied, and is achieved through three distinct patterns of variance: contrast, generalisation and fusion. We propose an approach to visualise the combination of nominal data and tacit knowledge by subjecting it to these three patterns. We illustrate our approach with two case studies from literary translations between Italy and the UK in the post-war 20th century. Our claim is that on one hand this guides scholars on how to analytically approach their research questions, on the other it drives them to externalise and validate hidden assumptions. Our approach offers a way of doing reproducible science not only when conducting literature research with bibliographic data.

Title: Profiling Anonymous Authors in the Corsican Autonomist Press of the Interwar Period
Abstract: With the emergence of nationalism in the 19 th ~century came regionalist movements to assert and claim cultural particularities. Corsica fitted very well within this dynamic and even presented itself as a favourable location for the development of such ideas. The centralization of the state around a strong capital and the policies of assimilation of the indigenous populations on the border with France led certain players to defend these particularisms. It was in this context that the Corsican autonomist newspaper  A Muvra  was born in May 1920 in Paris, under the impetus of Petru and Matteu Rocca. For almost 19 years, hundreds of authors participated in the writing of this massive dialectal work. This paper presents the results of a research that aimed to carry out author profiling, i.e., to determine the style and subjects covered by an author. The goals of this study were to determine the identity behind certain authors and also to highlight the role pseudonyms played in the newspaper’s propaganda. We conducted authorship attribution to achieve the first objective before completing these analyses with topic modelling in order to meet the second one.

Title:  : Emoji, language games and political polarisation
Abstract: Are emoji political? In an increasing body of research, emoji have variably been viewed as emotional data or personality identifiers. However, little attention has been paid to the social and political import of emoji. Using a dataset of politically active Twitter users in Poland, including 334 members of parliament and their 1,288,950 followers, we ask whether emoji are used for political self-representation, and discuss the implications for political identity formation and mobilisation online. Adapting a new method of ideal point estimation, we identify patterns in the employment of emoji in user Twitter bios across a latent political space computed from a Twitter following network. We find that emoji are used as stand-ins for offline political symbols such as  flag-european-union ,  rainbow-flag  and  latin-cross . Additionally, we find that the use of emoji without recognisable political meaning, such as  victory-hand ,  flexed-biceps ,  hundred-points  and  seedling  is contingent on a users estimated political ideal point. Users on the left are likelier to employ  victory-hand  and  seedling , while those on the right are likelier to employ  flexed-biceps  and  hundred-points . Using Ludwig Wittgenstein’s theory of language games, we argue that this points to the use of emoji for communication of both political values and affect, and to the development of a new political language game of emoji.

Title: If the Sources Could Talk: Evaluating Large Language Models for Research Assistance in History
Abstract: The recent advent of powerful Large-Language Models (LLM) provides a new conversational form of inquiry into historical memory (or, training data, in this case). We show that by augmenting such LLMs with vector embeddings from highly specialized academic sources, a conversational methodology can be made accessible to historians and other researchers in the Humanities. Concretely, we evaluate and demonstrate how LLMs have the ability of assisting researchers while they examine a customized corpora of different types of documents, including, but not exclusive to: (1). primary sources, (2). secondary sources written by experts, and (3). the combination of these two. Compared to established search interfaces for digital catalogues, such as metadata and full-text search, we evaluate the richer conversational style of LLMs on the performance of two main types of tasks: (1). question-answering, and (2). extraction and organization of data. We demonstrate that LLMs semantic retrieval and reasoning abilities on problem-specific tasks can be applied to large textual archives that have not been part of the its training data. Therefore, LLMs can be augmented with sources relevant to specific research projects, and can be queried privately by researchers.

Title: On Character Perception and Plot Structure of German Romance Novel
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a plot model for German dime novel romances. Starting with the identification of essential structural parts of their plot based on scholarly analysis of romances, we then formalize this conceptual model.   After a description of the corpus with its 950 novels, mostly from the last 20 years, and the annotation guidelines for the selected plot elements, we automatically detect these elements using a fine-tuned German Bert (with LoRA adapters). While it is clear how to evaluate the performance of the automatic extraction of the plot elements, it is less clear how to evaluate the quality of the model in total. We apply it to two texts and compare the result to summaries of these novels based on reading them, to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the plot model in making aspects of the plot structure visible.  For the quantitative evaluation each novel is represented as a multidimensional time series data. Classifications of this data distinguish between publishers, genres and series respectively; we see the performance in this task as an indication of the quality of the model. Finally, applying the model to a larger corpus of romance novels, we detect patterns of the genre. The more modern form of the romance novel, published by the publishing house  Cora , is characterized by the importance of the physical perception and the reduction of the plot with the high and exclusive focus on the relationship of the lovers.

Title: Enhancing HTR of Historical Texts through Scholarly Editions: A Case Study from an Ancient Collation of the Hebrew Bible
Abstract: Printed critical editions of literary texts are a largely neglected source of knowledge in computational humanities. However, under certain conditions, they hold significant potential for multifaceted exploration: First, through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text and its apparatus, coupled with intelligent parsing of the variant readings, it becomes possible to reconstruct comprehensive manuscript collations, which can prove invaluable for a variety of investigations, including phylogenetic analyses, redaction history studies, linguistic inquiries, and more. Second, by aligning the printed edition with manuscript images, a substantial amount of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) ground truth can be generated. This serves as valuable material for paleography, layout analysis, as well as for assessing the quality of the collation criteria adopted by the editor. The present paper focuses on the challenges mastered in the processes of the OCR, the apparatus parsing, the text reconstruction, and the alignment with the manuscript images, taking as a case study the edition of the Hebrew Bible published by Kennicott in the late eighteenth century.     %After a brief introduction (§ \ref{introduction}) and a description of this edition (§ \ref{kennicott}), we will provide an overview of the adopted method (§ \ref{pipeline}), from image acquisition (§ \ref{image_acquisition}) to the final textual reconstruction (§ \ref{text_reconstruction}). Finally, we will conclude with an assessment of the work carried out and an outlook on potential future developments (§ \ref{conclusion}).

Title: Modeling Narrative Revelation
Abstract: A core aspect of human storytelling is the element of narrative time. In this paper, we propose a model of narrative revelation using the information-theoretic concept of relative entropy, which has been used in a variety of settings to understand textual similarity, along with methods in time-series analysis to model the properties of revelation over narrative time. Given a beginning state of no knowledge about a story (beyond paratextual clues) and an end state of full knowledge about a story’s contents, what are the rhythms of dissemination through which we arrive at this final state? Using a dataset of over 2,700 books of contemporary English prose, we test for various time-dependent characteristics of narrative revelation against four stylistic categories of interest: audience age level, prestige, point-of-view, and fictionality.

Title: Blind Dates: Examining the Expression of Temporality in Historical Photographs
Abstract: This paper explores the capacity of computer vision models to discern temporal information in visual content, focusing specifically on historical photographs. We investigate the dating of images using OpenCLIP, an open-source implementation of CLIP, a multi-modal language and vision model. Our experiment consists of three steps: zero-shot classification, fine-tuning, and analysis of visual content. We use the  De Boer Scene Detection  dataset, containing 39,866 gray-scale historical press photographs from 1950 to 1999. The results show that zero-shot classification is relatively ineffective for image dating, with a bias towards predicting dates in the past. Fine-tuning OpenCLIP with a logistic classifier improves performance and eliminates the bias. Additionally, our analysis reveals that images featuring buses, cars, cats, dogs, and people are more accurately dated, suggesting the presence of temporal markers. The study highlights the potential of machine learning models like OpenCLIP in dating images and emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning for accurate temporal analysis. Future research should explore the application of these findings to color photographs and diverse datasets.

Title: The Chatbot and the Canon: Poetry Memorization in LLMs
Abstract: Large language models are able to memorize and generate long passages of text from their pretraining data. Poetry is commonly available on the web and often fits within language model context sizes. As LLMs continue to grow as a tool in literary analysis, the accessibility of poems will determine the effective canon. We assess whether we can prompt current language models to retrieve existing poems, and what methods lead to the most successful retrieval. For the highest performing model, ChatGPT, we then evaluate which features of poets best predict memorization, as well as document changes over time in ChatGPT’s ability and willingness to retrieve poetry.

Title: Introducing Traveling Word Pairs in Historical Semantic Change: A Case Study of Privacy Words in 18th and 19th Century English
Abstract: In recent years, Lexical semantic change detection (LSCD) has become a central task of NLP.   Because most studies in LSCD only consider the semantic change of words in isolation, in this paper, we propose a new direction for the analysis of semantic shifts:  traveling word pairs . First, we introduce shift correlation to find pairs of words that semantically shift together in a similar fashion. Second, we propose word relation shift to analyze how the relationship between two words has changed over time. As a test case, we investigate the word  privacy (and related words identified by a pre-existing dictionary), as an example of a word that has shifted semantics historically and remains vibrantly explored as a concept in contemporary humanistic discourse. We report that the term  privacy  in comparison shows relatively little change initially – with correlation analysis revealing more about how key terms surrounding  privacy  have shifted in tandem, and explore nuanced changes through word pair analysis, suggesting a shift toward concreteness in particular.

Title: (De)constructing Binarism in Journalism: Automatic Antonym Detection in Dutch Newspaper Articles
Abstract: Binary oppositions, since their introduction by Claude Levi-Strauss and other structuralists in the seventies, are under pressure, especially because they legitimatize societal power structures. Deconstruction of binary oppositions such as man/woman, black/white, left/right, and rich/poor is therefore increasingly encouraged. The question arises of what kind of effect the debate about binary oppositions has had on its linguistic use. We have therefore detected antonyms in a corpus of Dutch newspaper articles from the period 1990-2020, to study the development of binarism in journalism. Our method consists of two parts: the use of a good-old lexicon, and the finetuning of a BERT model for antonym detection. In this paper, we not only present our results regarding the (de)construction of binary oppositions in Dutch journalism, but we also reflect on the two methodological stages and discuss their gain.

Title: German Question Tags: A Computational Analysis
Abstract: The German language exhibits a range of question tags that can typically, but not always, be substituted for one another. Moreover, the same words can have other meanings while occurring in the sentence-final position. The tags’ felicity conditions were addressed in previous corpus-based and experimental work and attributed to semantic and pragmatic properties of tag questions. This paper addresses the question of whether and to what extent the differences among German tags can be determined automatically. We assess the performance of three pretrained German BERT models on a tag question dataset and fine-tune one of these models on the tag word prediction task. A close examination of this model’s output indicates that BERT can identify properties relevant for the tags’ felicity conditions and interchangeability consistent with previous studies.

Title: Operationalizing and Measuring Conflict in German Novels
Abstract: In this contribution we explore ways of detecting conflict representation in literary texts. First, we operationalize Glasl’s concept of social conflict for manual annotation and second, we adapt a word embedding-based sentiment analysis ( SentiArt ) for the attribution of conflict values based on two scalar conflict operationalizations. By translating the values of the latter approaches into binary labels, we compare the embedding approaches with the manual annotation. Though correlation between the approaches is low, the paper demonstrates possible approaches to conflict analysis in literary texts and outlines directions for future research.

Title:  Modeling temporal uncertainty in historical datasets
Abstract: This paper explores several approaches to assess temporal trends within archaeological and historical datasets containing records marked with significant extent of uncertainty accompanying their dating. We evaluate the strengths and pitfalls of these methodologies by employing two datasets: one comprising ancient shipwrecks and the other ancient Greek inscriptions. While these objects can, in principle, be precisely dated to specific years, they are often assigned broader date ranges, spanning centuries or longer historical periods. We propose that the most promising approaches involve using these date ranges as defining probabilities. By randomly assigning specific dates based on these probabilities, we enable hypothesis testing for temporal trends. As we want to encourage other scholars to employ the methods we propose, we offer a detailed description of the implementation of these methods using functions from the Python  tempun  package.

Title: How Exactly does Literary Content Depend on Genre? A Case Study of Animals in Children’s Literature
Abstract: The content of literary fiction at least partly depends on literary   tradition. The dependence is attested quantitatively in the   association of genre with lexical statistical patterns.  This short   paper is a step to formal modeling of the content-moderating   processes associated with literary genres.  The idea is to explain   prevalence of the particular lemmas in a literary text by the   genre-dependent accessibility of the semantic category during the   creative process. Data on animals mentioned in various sub-genres in   a corpus of Russian children’s literature is used as an empirical   case. Vocabulary growth models are applied to infer genre-related   differences in overall diversity of animal vocabularies. A   constrained topic model is employed to infer preferences for   particular animal lemmas displayed by various genres. Results   demonstrate the models’ potential to infer genre-related content   preferences in the context of high variance and data imbalance.

Title: Using Online Catalogs to Estimate Economic Development in Classical Antiquity
Abstract: Despite significant progress, economic development in Classical Antiquity remains difficult to study: proper economic data (e.g. agricultural production, wages) are scarce, estimates of urbanization, GDP or population remain highly uncertain, and the use of indirect markers of development such as shipwrecks or coin hoards is limited. Here, we propose a different approach based on the production of immaterial works (e.g. poems, philosophical treatises, musical pieces, scientific work). Immaterial works require time, energy, resources, and human capital to be produced, disseminated and appreciated, and thus indirectly reflect a wide range of economic processes. Moreover, their survival rate tends to be higher because they can be abstracted from their initial material incarnation (e.g. scrolls, manuscripts) and preserved throughout the centuries. We build a large database of cultural producers (painters, scientists, etc.) that exist in online catalogs (Library of Congress ID, GND ID, VIAF ID, Iranica ID etc) and create an estimate of immaterial production that is robust and consistent across cultures and sources. We show that immaterial production in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome is closely related to economic development, and reveals important phases of economic development. Overall, immaterial production provides new insights into the roots and the evolution of economic development in the very long run in Classical Antiquity.

Based on ParlaMint data, researchers Bojan Evkoski and Senja Pollak developed and then explained machine learning models in order to understand the language used by Slovenian members of parliament associated with different political leanings during the migrant crisis from 2014-2020.
With the models showing great predictive success, the researchers then used explainability techniques in order to identify the key words and phrases that have the strongest influence on predicting the political leaning on the topic. The researchers argue that understanding the reasoning behind predictions can be helpful as a tool for qualitative analysis in interdisciplinary research.

        <p>(F) “Visualisation des données de recensement de la rue du Brill en 1922” est né comme un projet interdisciplinaire expérimental qui favoriserait le dialogue public sur l’histoire. La matérialisation des données de recensement de plus de 100 ménages (près de 500 personnes) vivant dans la rue du Brill (Esch-sur-Alzette) en 1922 devait permettre aux habitants actuels de s’intéresser aux données historiques de leur quartier d’une manière nouvelle, créative et ludique.
(GER) „Visualisierung des Historischen Archivs für die Bürger” wurde als experimentelles interdisziplinäres Projekt ins Leben gerufen, das den öffentlichen Dialog über Geschichte fördern sollte. Die Visualisierung der Volkszählungsdaten von mehr als 100 Haushalten (fast 500 Personen), die 1922 in der Brillstraße (Esch-sur-Alzette) lebten, sollte es den heutigen Bewohnern ermöglichen, sich auf neue, kreative und spielerische Weise mit den historischen Daten ihres Viertels auseinanderzusetzen.

D’Joëlla van Donkersgoed an d’Laura Steil, Fuerscher am C²DH, hunn zesumme mat de Leit vun Esch historesch Fuerschung gemaach fir eng “Volleksgeschicht” ze kreéieren. Bei dëser Presentatioun fokuseieren si seich op dräi Projeten – Escher Kaffi, HistorEsch an Dancing Esch – a beliichten wéi si hir Recherche gemaach hunn. Si konzentreieren sech virun allem op d’Wichtigkeet vun der Forschungsethik, weisen op wéi Bezéiungen mat den Individuen an den Gemeinschaften am Zentrum vun Projeten stinn an gin dorop an daat Relatiounen duerch Vertrauen opgebaut gin. Am Kontext vu Lëtzebuerg, wou d’Intimitéit an d’Verbindung an de lokale Communautéiten besonnesch héich sinn, spillen Rapport a Géigesäitegkeet eng wesentlech Roll an der Fuerschungszesummenaarbecht.

Join us as we celebrate Frederick Douglass&#x27; Birthday by taking part in the annual Douglass Day Transcribe-a-thon event organized by the Center for Black Digital Research at Penn State
What is Douglass Day? 
 
Douglass Day is an annual holiday celebrated on February 14th, the chosen birthday of Frederick Douglass. As Douglass never knew his actual birthdate, his family chose Valentine’s Day to commemorate his life. The holiday was established after Douglass’ passing in 1895, when influential activist Mary Church Terrell proposed a national holiday to honor his legacy. Douglass Day events were widespread in the early 20th century and served as inspiration for the creation of Black History Month. In 20…</p>

        <p>Vor inzwischen fast 40 Jahren wurde mit dem Vorschlag, sich der Erforschung kultureller Transfers zu widmen, eine Debatte eröffnet, die das Methodenspektrum der Geschichtswissenschaft erheblich erweitert hat und auch das Verhältnis zu einem klassischen Verständnis von Vergleich berührt hat. Im Laufe der letzten Jahrzehnte traf diese Debatte auf eine ganze Reihe weiterer Vorschläge aus der transnationalen und Globalgeschichte, aus der Kultur- und Sozialgeschichte, aus den Diskussionen um Postkolonialismus und reciprocal comparisons. Trotzdem oder gerade deswegen ist regelmäßig wiederkehrend die Frage aufgeworfen worden, ob es sich nun um ein etabliertes Verfahren oder um einen noch immer umstrittenen und fragilen Vorschlag handele. Der Vortrag situiert diese Debatte in der Forschungsgeschichte und versucht sich an einer pragmatischen Kombination von Vergleich und Transfer.

        <p>For its first one hundred and fifty years, the U.S. government had relatively few secrets, and subsidized the free flow of information to ensure democratic accountability. But all that changed after Pearl Harbor, with the rise of the dark state. The last two decades have witnessed particularly dramatic growth in government secrecy, at the same time that declassification has all but collapsed. Now that so much is secret, it has become all but impossible to protect truly dangerous information. Connelly explores the policies and practices that gave rise to the current crisis, above all presidents’ determination to preserve sovereign power over “national security information.” The digital archiving methods that were supposed to stop unauthorized leaks instead gave rise to Wikileaks, and the wholesale destruction of the documentary record has made it all but impossible even for historians to hold public officials to account. But new data science methods now make it possible to systematically analyze patterns and anomalies in state secrecy, and show not only what the government did not want us to know, but why.
 


 
Matthew Connelly is a professor of international and global history at Columbia University, and director of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. Connelly is also the principal investigator of History Lab, a project that uses data science to analyze state secrecy. His publications include A Diplomatic Revolution: Algeria&#x27;s Fight for Independence and the Origins of the Post-Cold War Era, Fatal Misconception: The Struggle to Control World Population, and The Declassification Engine: What History Reveals about America’s Top Secrets. Connelly received his B.A. from Columbia in 1990 and earned his Ph.D. from Yale in 1997.

        <p>Colonial statues in Africa have often been analysed as isolated case studies. Moving beyond a one case study model, this presentation adopts a regional, thematic, and historical approach to elucidate the diverse ways in which African nations have grappled with colonial statues from the time of independences. The paper begins by examining the fate of colonial statues at the time of independences, exploring why certain monuments were removed, repurposed, or preserved. Subsequently, the paper delves into the reasons for the revival of (neo)colonial statues in the 1990s and early 2000s. Finally, the paper discusses recent and renewed contestations of colonial statues from the 2010s, in the light of global movements against symbols of oppression. This presentation aims to shed light on the comp…</p>

Abstract
Museums expect to be called out, there is inbuilt conflict. Museums are forged in a ‘cunning’ liberal constitutional structure (Povinelli 2002): to conserve for future generations; to make collections accessible to everyone now; to represent the world; to shape the world. Ideals so big they can never be achieved, creating a constitutive deficit. Ideals which also are often in tension, requiring endless negotiation.
‘Museum constitution’ is also forged in creating norms. In ruling certain ideas, perspectives and practices as unsayable, beyond that which can be contained and constitutionally metabolised.

        <p>For two days, presenters from public history, memory studies, museology, and participatory design will trace intersections of agonism, constituent power, and horizontal politics to activate their potential for transforming institutionalised practices. From digitisation practices and virtual exhibitions, to navigating contested history and memory discourses, to mobilising craft and counter-framing design practices, the case studies demonstrate the breadth of opportunities to inform a participatory agonistic practice impacting mid to long-term strategies in cultural venues.

        <p>Letterboxes, representing shell companies, are an emblematic symbol for a form of international capitalism that has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years and serve as a focal point for international criticism of the Luxembourgish financial system.
LETTERBOX is an innovative project that mixes recent questions in financial history with cutting-edge digital history. During the seminar we will address the challenges we have in making a very large corpus readable and present first results of our research.

        <p>How can scholarly critiques of games about WWII and Holocaust histories inform game making? And how can making a game about these topics enrich public history research? Such questions are guiding development of Beyond Nuremberg, a VR quest-game to collect, analyze, and contextualize primary sources related to the Nuremberg Trials and Holocaust. The talk will address how the team is using process analysis, formative assessments, and other critical making approaches to engage the practical, theoretical, and ethical questions that arise when using VR to engage with historical complexity, traumatic events, and still-vital human rights issues.

        <p>Encounters with new technologies often bring with them opportunities to create new narratives, but they also bear the potential to entrench existing ones that have prioritized certain perspectives in place of others. This presentation looks at the ways in which digital tools and platforms are currently being used within the museum sector across different African countries. What challenges do these platforms present and how do they allow practitioners to subvert entrenched ideologies? Most importantly, it looks at the implementation of these technologies and questions what is needed to successfully scale, implement and support a growing ecosystem of digital cultural practitioners in the region?

        <p>How do video games represent the past and bring history to life? How accurately do they portray historical events? How do game designers balance between facts and creative storytelling? Can games be used in the classroom as tools for history education? Can they be used to improve our understanding of historical processes and promote social, political, and cultural activism?
For this Forum Z, we are teaming up with the Rotondes cultural centre, the gaming convention Game On, and the BTS school of Game Programming and Game Design to explore the intersection between history and play.
The event will take place at the Rotondes as part of the Game On convention and will consist of a rich programme of activities spread between the Grande Salle and the Container City:

  ) in recent years, improved evaluation methods are needed in order to determine which translation system is best for a given dataset, language pair or domain. MATEO (MAchine Translation Evaluation Online) is a new, user-friendly tool for both experts and non-experts that answers a growing need for easy and accessible evaluation of machine translation. The software was developed by  Bram Vanroy, Arda Tezcan, Lieve Macken and Michaël Lumingu from Ghent University, and was funded by a CLARIN Bridging Gaps grant after getting seed funding from the European Association for Machine Translation.

        <p>The Firm Worms &amp; Co was founded in the middle of the nineteenth century by the French merchant Hypolite Worms (1801-1877). From the beginning, the European and international vocation of his company led him to consider setting up in Great Britain: in Swansea, Newcastle, Great-Grimsby, … He ships French products there and brings back English coal sold on the French coast. He thus became a coal importer, then a maritime carrier opening lines linking Bordeaux, Le Havre and Rouen to Hamburg, Antwerp and to the North of Europe. Later, in the twentieth century, one sector of activity opening up prospects in another, his house will open branches or offices in Rotterdam, Genoa, Prague, Danzig, Warsaw, …

        <p>In this talk, Cinderella Petz will evaluate chances and challenges when combining computational methods in historical research and address the limitations and implications of its epistemological and ontological changes. She will exemplify this on two case studies based on her doctoral research: the analysis of court records assessing the extent of political judiciary during the Dollfuß-/Schuschnigg-Regime, and the structural analysis of the influence relations of a Linked Open Data network of intellectuals. 
She will propose to take the framework of modeling seriously for digital historical research in order to successfully tackle the research design, the structuring of data, and the evaluation of analysis. Furthermore, she stresses the importance of a multimodal literacy, as well as digital and computational competences as key for a successfull implementation of an embedded digital humanities framework.

        <p>In France, as elsewhere, the Covid 19 pandemic led to a large number of grassroots archiving projets. The aim of these initiatives was to collect the &#x27;ordinary&#x27; memory of the event and thus help to build a collective memory that reflected a diversity of experiences. Using qualitative and quantitative data, this article examines the genesis of these initiatives in France and draws up the socio-economic profile of the participants, asking the question: to what extent did these operations reach the entire target population in an egalitarian manner? What kind of memory will be preserved over the long term by the archive centres, and who are the people whose words will go down in history?
Sarah Gensburger is a Full Professor of Sociology at the French National Center for Scientific Research - Sciences Po Paris. In her most recent work, she has been investigating the relationship between memory, public policies and neoliberalism. She is the author of a dozen of books among which, in the perspective of this talk, Memory on my doorstep. Chronicles of the Bataclan Neighborhood (Paris, 2015-2016), (Leuven University Press, 2019), with Gérôme Truc (eds.), Les Mémoriaux du 13 novembre (Ed. EHESS, 2020) and with Orli Fridman (eds.), The Covid-19 Pandemic and Memory. Remembrance, commemoration, and archiving in crisis (Palgrave, 2023). In 2021, she was elected President of the Memory Studies Association.

        <p>I’m continuing to slog away at the Trove Data Guide (part of the ARDC’s HASS Community Data Lab) – dumping everything I know about Trove into a format that I hope will be useful for researchers.
I’ve just finished a first pass through the section on accessing data from newspapers and gazettes, and it’s online if you want to have a look. There’s still lots of things to add, update, and reorganise, but getting the basic content of the section defined is a bit of a milestone, so I’ll allow myself a little moment of celebration. Yay!

Of course it took longer than I expected, but that’s largely due to the fact that I was sketching out related sections as I went along. You’ll see lots of pages in the navigation that only contain a list of dot points, but they’ll get filled out over the next couple of months.
The ‘Accessing data’ section is going to be the most code heavy, as it’s focused on using the API to develop reusable methods for harvesting machine-readable data. Other sections, such as ‘Understanding search’ and ‘Collections and contexts’ will be more discursive, aimed at helping all Trove users better understand what Trove is and how it works.

        <p>In this research seminar, we will discuss the ongoing extraction of data from the administrative archives of Dudelange, relying on an automated transcription, with layout detection and the automated extraction of temporal and spatial information from these sources to create historical maps.
The city of Dudelange has entered a partnership with the C²DH, for which they shared their residential cards. These administrative forms contain information on the population movements in and out of the city. These are being scanned and transcribed.
For the transcription, the project uses Transkribus to restitute not only the textual content of these administrative forms but also their structure, e.g., for each field, a tag is attached. Secondly, for the blocs of texts, a script to detect place and time information is being developed internally. All these steps should lead up to the structuration before import of the data to be visualised on a map and open these rich collections for further analysis, on the history of migration, housing, public health etc.
We invite all interested persons to join the discussion on how to improve this pipeline and share other potential uses for the extracted material.

« Lectores, ils ne consultent plus guère les catalogues papier des bibliothèques, mais se reportent aux bases de données disponibles en ligne ; ils débutent toute recherche par une série de sondages sur diverses banques de textes ; ils continuent de manier les index à la fin des livres, mais ne conçoivent plus de se passer des moteurs de recherche par mots ou par suites de mots1. »
En dix ans, le constat peut être fait d’une tendance renforcée : l’usage répandu et fréquent, si ce n’est universel et quotidien, des…</p>

        <p>In April 2023, we released a call for paper entitled “Is artificial intelligence the future of collective memory? Bridging AI scholarship and Memory Studies”, in order to collect papers for a special issue of Memory Studies Review. Our aim was twofold: coordinating a special issue and identifying “a network of colleagues, across the two fields, who are interested in the development of co-conceived case studies and research programs”.
To discuss the making of the informal network, we are organising on 27 September at the University of Luxembourg, Belval campus, a workshop that will be divided into two parts: the morning will be devoted to the formation of this informal network and short presentations of each other works, and the afternoon to a sort of ‘datathon’ on sources and methods we could use to explore the links between AI and collective memory.

CfP - ‘Our Interlocked Universe’: Sociohistorical Network Analysis; Methods, Applications, and New Directions



University of Southampton, 26-27th March 2024
Keynote Speaker: Prof. Ruth Ahnert, Queen Mary University of London
In his canonical book, Linked, Albert-László Barabási explored the history and prevalence of networks in the world, and how studying them opens new avenues of understanding, predicting that “network thinking is poised to invade all domains of human activity and most fields of human inquiry… aimed at approaching our interlocked universe.” Often influenced by methodologies from the social sciences, this ‘network thinking’ and an interest in the use of digital and computational tools within the humanities continues to flourish. More recently, t…</p>

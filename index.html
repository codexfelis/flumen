        <p>2024: A Review

            
Written by Darja Fišer
2024 was another successful year for CLARIN! We welcomed new members (Spain and South Africa), increased the number of service and knowledge centres (now a total of 73), and worked hard to achieve two of our key strategic goals: improving interoperability and findability.
 
A new CLARIN Resource Family was developed for Corpora of Disordered Speech. It deals with a specific kind of speech data that is related to the recordings of individuals with communication disorders. These corpora are invaluable for education and research, but are costly and hard to build and can be difficult to share, given privacy and confidentiality issues. This new Resource Family currently lists around 20 corpora that are made available via CLARIN, covering nearl…</p>

        <p>Humming Home est une série d’événements qui visent à examiner comment différentes cultures, groupes communautaires et individus utilisent le son, la musique et le silence pour parler de leur histoire. Qu’ont en commun la musique et l’histoire ? Le son peut-il nous en dire plus sur le passé ? Quel rôle joue la voix dans ce contexte ? Et le silence ? Parle-t-il aussi ? La voix implique-t-elle une certaine maîtrise de l’histoire ? Comment les sons et leur absence se reflètent-ils dans notre mémoire politique et culturelle du passé ?
La série «Humming Home» démarre avec un concert de jazz en direct et une discussion avec le compositeur et musicien palestinien Mohamed Najem, du Mohammed Najem Quartet, le 16 janvier 2025.
L’événement comprendra :

        <p>@trovenewsbot has been around for more than eleven years now – originally sharing Trove newspaper articles on Twitter, and now on the Fediverse. But with the imminent closure of the botsin.space Mastodon instance, I’ve had to find it a new home. Say hello to the latest version: @trovenewsbot@wraggebots.net!

Instead of just moving the bot to an existing instance, I decided to set up my own using GoToSocial. I thought this would give me more control, and encourage me to resurrect some more of my old Twitter bots. I installed GoToSocial on the smallest available DigitalOcean droplet, following the ‘bare metal’ instructions. Beyond the usual faffing around with permissions and DNS, I didn’t have any major problems. The GoToSocial documention is very comprehensive, and includes useful advice …</p>

        <p>In this talk postdoc Marine Pierre (UCPH) and tenure track assistant professor Haakon A. Ikonomou (UCPH) will show how they use prosopography and biography to open up the black box of international public administrations, spanning from the League of Nations and the UN, via NATO and the OECD, to the European Parliament. The aim is to display how prosopographical databases and digital prosopography provide a “meso-level” of analysis, that allow us to connect the political and institutional layer of international organizations (macro) to the professional agency and worldview of individual officials (micro). This, in turn, recasts our understanding of how policies are conceived, institutionalized, and practiced in IOs. The talk will feature several concrete examples from recent and ongoing res…</p>

        <p>Tour de CLARIN: Interview with Erika Rimkutė and Virginijus Dadurkevičius

            
The conversation was led by Kristina Pahor de Maiti Tekavčič.
Could you please briefly introduce yourselves?
    
Erika: I became interested in corpus and computational linguistics around 2000. After defending my first research as a master&#x27;s student at Vytautas Magnus University (VMU), I continued my career at the same university as a doctoral student, and now I am a senior researcher at VMU Digital Resources and Interdisciplinary Research Institute (SITTI). I also share the research conducted at this institute with the students of VMU Department of Lithuanian Studies.

Written by Jurgita Vaičenonienė
Welcome to CLARIN-LT! In 2024, we are celebrating our 10-year anniversary – Lithuania became a full member of CLARIN ERIC on October 25, 2014, and a year later, a consortium of three partners was established. At present, the consortium includes six full partners: Vytautas Magnus University (coordinating institution), Kaunas Technology University, Vilnius University, and the newer consortium members Mykolas Romeris University, Baltic Institute of Advanced Technologies, and the Institute of Baltic Region History and Archaeology. Although the composition of our team members has changed over time, we have always been an interdisciplinary and international consortium. We are happy that the consortium has been recognised by th…</p>

        <p>Political violence is defined as the deliberate use of power and force to achieve political goals. It is characterized by both physical and psychological acts aimed at injuring or intimidating populations. In that sense, the word &quot;difficult&quot; in the title of this seminar refers to events in time that can be identified as acts of political violence.
In such circumstances, any attempt to do public history can certainly have its challenges. From ensuring participation, to working with silence, considering the mental health of both the participants and the project leaders, or anticipating the social impact before making this research public. 
During this seminar, Myriam Dalal will expand on the definition of the relatively new field of artistic research methodologies, which involves the creation of arts to help the practitioner/researcher improve, change or make their processes more effective, specific and articulated.
Myriam Dalal will then discuss how artistic research methodologies can work with and help address some of the challenges of documenting “difficult” histories, based on examples from her research projects (1) tackling war, its photographic representation in the case of Lebanon and (2) migration/exile and the displacement/belonging experience in Luxembourg.

The CLARIN Knowledge Centre for Swedish in a Multilingual Setting (CLARIN-SMS) is primarily directed at researchers in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and beyond with a need for analysis, annotation or data mining of Swedish or multilingual texts, and of Swedish Sign Language.
CLARIN-SMS makes resources in the form of tools for linguistic processing, as well as corpora available for research in the Humanities and Social Sciences. The resources include monolingual (mainly Swedish) and multilingual corpora across several domains, and tools for the basic processing of text, including tokenisation, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and named entity recognition.

        <p>A couple of months ago I realised my big, searchable database of Tasmanian Post Office Directories was missing the volume from 1920. It took a bit of work to add it in, as described in this post. Unfortunately, I’d barely finished when I realised that a number of other years were also missing! Argh! The good news is that I’ve been steadily working through these missing volumes, adding one a week, and now I’m finally, finally finished!

The new volumes are:
1920
1933-34
1941-42
1942-43
1943-44
1945-46
In total there are now 54 volumes from 1890 to 1948. Every line of every volume has been OCRd and indexed, so you can run fulltext searches across all 54 volumes to find matching entries. The fulltext search also supports advanced operators like wildcards and booleans.
As I mentioned in relation to 1920, while these volumes can be downloaded as PDFs from Libraries Tasmania, they don’t contain any OCRd text – they’re not searchable (despite what Libraries Tasmania says here). The quality of the scans is also quite variable – tight bindings cut off text, pages are skewed, and lighting is inconsistent. This means that the OCR processing is far from perfect. There will be names missing from the search index as a result of this. However, because you can search across all volumes at once, the database makes it easier to find people, as you can pick them up in one year and follow them through subsequent volumes, filling in any gaps.
It would be great if Libraries Tasmania would add a link to the database from their Directories and almanacs page. I’ve sent a couple of emails but haven’t received a reply. It seems odd that they’d link to commercial offerings like FindMyPast, but not to the free, community-developed version!</p>

        <p>Mobility Grant: Preparing Kielipankki Corpus for EuReCo

            
 
Written by Harald Lüngen
With my CLARIN mobility grant, I visited CSC, the Finnish IT Centre for Science in Espoo, Finland, which hosts the Finnish corpus archive Kielipankki that is part of FIN-CLARIN.

My official stay according to the grant was from 29 August until 6 September 2024, but I got the opportunity by my employer to stay a bit longer at CSC, and I had planned the scope of my project for the extended stay. In my project, I wanted to prepare a subcorpus from the Kielipankki archives for the European Reference Corpus initiative EuReCo, and also to try and set up a KorAP instance for EuReCo at CSC.

EuReCo is an initiative that aims to create (pairs of) comparable corpora by making existing corpora maintained …</p>

        <p>WW2.lu. Luxemb(o)urg in the Second World War is an online exhibition developed by the C²DH of the University of Luxembourg based on a 2021 convention with the Ministry of State. The aim of the exhibition is to present the history of Luxembourg during the Second World War, taking account of recent historical research. To this end, it relies on the advantages of the digital format. The exhibition makes it possible to approach the experiences of Luxembourgers from different perspectives by drawing on rich and often unknown documentation.
Between ‘Luxembourg’ and ‘Luxemburg’, the population faced the Germanisation efforts of the Nazi regime. The period of annexation shows a torn society whose first concern was to cope with everyday life in an exceptional situation. The online exhibition is int…</p>

        <p>In this talk, Gerben Zaagsma will discuss the history and genealogies of digital history within the broader context of how new technologies have shaped historical research practices and knowledge production since the late nineteenth century. To do so, he will first explore the current historiography and origin myths of digital history while advocating for greater consideration of disciplinary differences in histories of the digital humanities.
In the second part, he discusses how we might frame a history of digital history. If an imagined “collective” memory exists, the history of digital history started in the 1960s in the United States and Western Europe, involved mostly digital electronic computing employed to support quantitative approaches, and occurred within national silos.

Drawing on two projects I have developed—CerCAST (Ceramics Route of Castelli) and LICA Routes (Locating Indonesian Cultural Archives)—the lecture demonstrates how crossing disciplinary boundaries can challenge and broaden current understandings of identity, heritage, and cultural narratives in an era shaped by digital hybridity.

Its records are among the most important that are deposited in The National Archives, covering those of the Prime Minister, Cabinet proceedings, government efficiency and reform, and the formulation of legislation, among other areas.

        <p>The SNF (Swiss National Science Foundation) project ‘Horror – Game – Politics’ analysed a sample of 22 digital horror games in terms of their history of ideas. Project manager Eugen Pfister’s aim was to prove that digital games in general, and digital horror games in particular, frequently communicate discursive political statements. This happens both consciously, when developers intend to communicate a specific statement, and unconsciously in the form of myths as described by Roland Barthes. There has long been a consensus in research that a history of ideas and political history cannot be reconstructed solely on the basis of individual political texts. In democratic societies in particular, political communication takes place not only in parliaments and political essays, but also to a large extent in popular culture.
Dott. Ric. Dr. phil. Eugen Pfister is historian and political scientist. In particular, he researches the history of ideas and political history in digital games. He is currently leading the SNF-Sinergia project, ‘Swiss History of Games, Play and Game Design 1968-2000,’ with a team of 20 colleagues at four Swiss universities. Previously, he led the SNSF project ‘Horror-Game-Politics’ at the Bern University of the Arts. He studied at the Universität Wien and the Université Paris IV – Sorbonne. He wrote his PhD in the history of political communication in co-tutelle at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität Frankfurt am Main and the Università degli Studi di Trento. In 2015, he and 15 colleagues founded the Working Group for History and Digital Games (AKGWDS), which has since grown to over 300 members.

        <p>Aliénor Gandanger of the University of Luxembourg and Rachel Beck of the University of Limerick (Ireland) are proud to organise a webinar exploring the confluence of history and webcomic-making. The participants are all creators of historical comics and webcomics. The purpose of the webinar is for us to share our experiences, but not only that - we are also endeavouring to develop ‘history and webcomics’ as a field of study in its own right. By bringing the participants together, we hope to encourage collaboration between creator-historians and (academic) public historians. This event is unique in that it is the first time history-based webcomics have come under theoretical scrutiny.

While digital methods are increasingly common in the humanities, the status of &quot;Digital Humanities&quot; has evolved over the years. Once a cutting-edge buzzword, DH has grown into a vast umbrella covering a myriad of scholarly activities that can nevertheless be a polarizing concept.
 
The purpose of this meeting of the Graduate Student Working Group in Digital Humanities is to have a candid discussion about strategies for talking about and representing digital work in professional contexts including but not limited to job interviews. It should be useful for students who have solid DH experience as well as those who are trying to decide how much time and energy to invest in digital work

        <p>In 2021, the American Historical Association published a study on how the American public perceives and understands the past. Almost half of the respondents argued that they turn to Wikipedia to learn about history and acquire a historical understanding of the past. Wikipedia was ranked higher than other historical activities, such as “Historic site visit,” “Museum visit,” “Genealogy work,” “Social media,” “Podcast/radio program,” “History lecture,” and “History-related video game.” These findings combined with the appropriation of Wikipedia’s corpus by ChatGPT and Wikipedia’s partnership with the most central search engine in the digital world, Google, and other digital assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, make clear how crucial the role of Wikipedia in how the public learns about history …</p>

It discusses the origins of gas street lightening in Luxembourg in the 1890s, the involvement of German gas companies in the Luxembourgish gas sector until 1944, the take-over of Société générale pour le gaz et l’électricité Ltd. by Luxembourgish communes in 1953, as well as the more recent evolution of the company.

The first and most glaring use of generative AI involving Hellenistic Central Asia is AI-generated imagery.

This year, the CLARIN Annual Conference was a hybrid event in Barcelona, Spain. With more than 200 in-person participants and close to 150 online participants, this was an engaging and successful event. In addition to engaging keynote speeches, more than 20 abstract presentations, and interactive poster sessions, the conference also included the very first Building Bridges with Industry session. And as it is now becoming a tradition, during the conference dinner, the CLARINets (i.e., the CLARIN band) d…</p>

The CLARIN Resource Families (CRF) provide user-friendly overviews of available language resources in the CLARIN infrastructure for researchers from the digital humanities, social sciences and human language technologies. Many CRF are datasets of various types, including corpora, lexicons and software applications and tools. Until now, a missing resource family was the Corpora for Speech with Disorders (CSD), or the corpora with speech from individuals with language and speech disorders.

Omeka is a content management system (CMS) designed by digital humanists at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. It allows you to create online collections and digital exhibits without knowing any code. Thinking about a tool like Omeka also gives us the opportunity to get into some of the most common questions in DH around maintenance, sustainability, collaboration, labor, digital representation, and the politics of metadata … and probably a few other things too. The goal of the workshop isn’t necessarily to promote Omeka (evene though it is an excellent tool for many applications) but rather to give you the information you need to decide if Omeka is right for you (and if it isn’t, what alternatives there might be).

In this workshop, I will introduce and demo a few very easy to use tools including:
Voyant (easy Text Analysis)
TimelineJS (easy Time Line builder)
StoryMapper (easy interactive maping)
 
I’ll also talk a little about free options for building quick websites. If you’ve already seen me do something like this before, it is unlikely that I will go over anything new so don’t feel compelled to come. On the other hand, if you haven’t seen it, it sounds like people often find it to be useful.

Amy Hillier, MSW, PhD, is an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy &amp; Practice. The two were graduate school classmates at Penn and co-direct a public history project called The Ward: Race and Class in Du Bois’ Seventh Ward. The project aims to teach people about the great civil rights leader and scholar, W.E.B. Du Bois, and his 1899 book, The Philadelphia Negro through research, neighborhood walking tours, a documentary, interactive mapping, a board game, and oral histories. During this presentation, they will describe recent efforts to catalog and extend their project scope. They will demonstrate some of the current content and invite participants to help workshop ideas for their new website and the next phase of this 20-year-old project.

        <p>This lecture first examines historical and contemporary patterns of human and non-human mobilizations that emerge when certain archival collections gain attention—earning archival value—from official institutions, professional archivists, critical scholars, and researchers. In this context, it is essential to consider the distinct intentions of both mainstream and alternative agents involved in these collections. Additionally, the varying motivations, methods, and means of visibly activating and utilizing these archives must be noted. As these dynamics unfold, questions arise concerning the limitations of accessibility, competition over full ownership and representation, and the ongoing debate between quantity and quality in archival practices. Building on my experience with Shubra’s Archive—Egypt’s first neighborhood-based community archive—the second part of the lecture expands on these questions and debates by integrating vernacular archival practices informed and performed by local residents and researchers. The main argument is that the presence of a place that ethnographically archives and engages with its space in the here and now opens up innovative situated ethical, logistical, and social endeavors. These endeavors not only interrogate the value-making processes of archival collections but also highlight the ruses and risks of aspiring toward exhaustive and accessible archives.

        <p>In early February, the Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI) announced a new pilot programme designed to support the sustainability of ‘legacy’ research collections, i.e. research materials from closed projects, not previously published in a data repository for long-term preservation and access. Researchers or research groups were eligible to apply for a single deposit allocation (one […]

        <p>In July 1843, after years of negotiation and resistance, the State of Ohio cast the last Native American tribe from its borders. Though the Wyandot reserved their legal right to remain until 1844, theft and land speculation by white settlers made staying in their homes untenable. Nearly 700 tribal citizens walked 240 kilometers from the Grand Reserve in Upper Sandusky to Cincinnati, Ohio. There, they boarded steamboats bound for unknown, unfamiliar lands in Kansas, over 1,150 kilometers away.
Ohio has forgotten about the Wyandot, as well as the larger story of their Removal and resistance. Wingo began a partnership with the the Cultural Division of the Wyandotte Nation in 2021 to reconstitute the Wyandot(te)’s legacy and repair Ohio’s historical amnesia. Their work consists of two (in-progress) community-based public history projects: the Wyandot Removal Trail and the Wyandot Heritage Digital Archive.
These projects are about reclamation as much as it is about Removal. Ohio, and the Midwest more broadly, mythologizes its past by laying claim to various freedoms: free from tyranny, free from slavery, and since 1843, also free from Indians. In coproducing this project, the Wyandotte are reclaiming control of their history, but how do they ensure the long term sustainability of these important resources?

        <p>The most iconic monsters in modern pop culture, including the vampire, the zombie, Frankenstein’s monster and even the mummy, have been the subject of numerous critical studies that have explored their cultural dimensions – or, in other words, the social, historical and political significance of the narratives in which they appear. The werewolf, on the other hand, has often been reduced to “the beast within,” or a psychoanalytic analogue for the bestial side of man. Phases of the Moon: A Cultural History of the Werewolf Film (2020) redresses the balance by providing wolf men and she-wolves with the same level of cultural analysis as has been afforded to their fellow monsters.
This talk, drawn from Phases of the Moon, will explore the evolution of the werewolf from antiquity to modern cinem…</p>

        <p>What if the Nazis had won World War II? What if J.F. Kennedy had survived the assassination? What if the Cold War had ended in nuclear devastation?
Games often engage with counterfactual history, exploring events that didn’t happen but might have, inviting players to consider not only how different outcomes could have shaped the world we live in today, but also why certain events unfolded the way they did.
For this new appointment with History@Play, the C²DH is proud to once again team up with Rotondes, Game On, and the BTS school of Game Programming and Game Design to explore how video games reimagine the past.
The GRAND SALLE will showcase a selection of video games that reimagine key historical moments and immerse players in alternate histories.
In the STUDIOS, we will present a historical board game workshop in collaboration with the BTS school of Game Programming and Game Design.
Working in teams, the participants will learn the ropes of game design by creating games that explore how different choices could have altered key moments in Luxembourg’s history.

        <p>Visualisation is a great way to find problems in your data.
As part of the Everyday Heritage project, I’m working with a team to document the lives of Tasmania’s Chinese residents in the 19th and early 20th centuries. We’re using a variety of sources such as Trove’s newspapers, the Tasmanian Names Index, and the Tasmanian Post Office Directories. To help with the research, I converted all the PDF volumes of the Post Office Directories into a public, online, searchable database. Or at least, I thought I had.
The Tasmanian Post Office Directories database embeds metadata about each line of text in its results, so it’s easy to save items of interest using Zotero. A member of our team has already saved hundreds of entries this way. The other day I started pulling these entries out of Zotero us…</p>

        <p>Dr. Inna Ganschow’s presentation is a nuanced reconstruction of the historical events concerning Soviet forced laborers in Luxembourg during World War II. The talk will present research findings that will be published in a monograph in 2024 answering the research question: ‘What were the living and working conditions of Soviet forced laborers in Luxembourg during World War II, as seen from German, American, and Soviet documentation, and what impact did these experiences have on their lives after their return?’ The internal seminar for C²DH is especially informative since several camps for young civilians from Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, as well as for Soviet prisoners of war, were located on the Belval University campus, which is situated on the site of the former ARBED steelworks using the forced labor during WWII.

        <p>To understand the internet, one must understand advertising. But what is advertising, exactly? Is it simply a way to inform consumers about products and services? Is it large companies gathering consumer data? Hidden technologies for tracking and profiling? Public policies regulating data markets or leaving them unfettered?
Advertising is all these things and more. In this talk, Matthew Crain will outline a political economic approach to advertising, foregrounding the concepts of social relations and structural power.

          <h3>Major update for the Trove Newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>
        </a>
        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://updates.timsherratt.org/>Tim Sherratt</a> |
          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>The Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench was updated last week. Over the last year I’ve been gradually updating notebooks to use version 3 of the Trove API, but when version 2 suddenly disappeared a couple of weeks ago I had to hurriedly pull everything together. The Trove newspapers section includes 23 notebooks and 6 datasets, so it’s not a small job. The changes include:
updated all notebooks to use version 3 of the Trove API
removed remaining datasets from the code repository and created dedicated data repositories for them, integrating them with Zenodo where appropriate
added metadata to all the notebooks – this is used to build an RO-Crate metadata file for the code repository
updated all the Python packages
added a voila.json file to configure Voilá
None of the functionality of the notebooks should have changed. There’s a slight difference in the Finding non-English newspapers in Trove notebook because the language detection library I was using is no longer maintained. I’ve swapped in py3langid and it seems to work well, though the results are a little different. Interestingly, where the previous library thought that bad OCR was ‘Maltese’, the new one detects it as ‘Latin’! There’s no change to the list of newspapers with non-English language content detected by the notebook.

The documentation pages have also been updated. The notebook pages are now built using data from the code repository’s RO-Crate file. They also include embedded HTML previews of the notebooks. If a notebook generates visualisations, the visualisations are usually included in the HTML, so you can explore the outputs without running the notebook – see, for example, the charts in Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state. Most of the dataset pages now include links to explore the contents using Datasette-Lite.
I still have to generate RO-Crate files for all the data repositories, but I wanted to get the code stuff finished first.</p>

        <p>It’s pretty obvious that access to digitised resources, like Trove’s newspapers, has changed the practice of history in Australia. But how? I’m certain that the historiographical implications of the growth and development of online collections will become a topic of increasing interest to historians, and that exploration of this topic will lead to important insights into the relationship between what we keep, what we value, and what we know. But for this to happen we need to have data documenting changes in online collections. What became available when? How was it delivered to users? How did the search indexing work?
In general, GLAM collection interfaces exist in an eternal present – they’re not good at explaining changes, or communicating their own histories. Australian GLAM organisatio…</p>

Dr. Tajah Ebram will talk about her current work with The Black Bibliography Project (BBP). The BBP is creating a digital database of Black book history with the aim of revealing the dynamic social networks and aesthetic practices specific to Black print cultures in the U.S.  During her talk, she will discuss her background in Black literary and cultural studies and how this informs her current work with the BBP. Her current research with the project is focused on developing and curating, in collaboration with graduate researchers, a corpus centering the print cultures of books authored by incarcerated Black writers and organizers of the late 20th century. The talk will explore the print cultures of Black prison movements while also attending to critical political, ethical and descriptive considerations involved in developing data about these works and writers. 

Dr. Tajah Ebram is a cultural historian, teacher and community memory worker. She is currently the Black Studies Librarian at Rutgers University New Brunswick and the Rutgers lead for the Black Bibliography Project. Prior to her work at Rutgers, she was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Haverford College where she developed seminars around Black feminisms, carceral studies and Black environmentalism.  In 2020, she completed her PhD in English at the University of Pennsylvania where she focused on Philly Black freedom movements through the lenses of oral history, digital storytelling, and material culture.

        <p>I was recently contacted by a researcher who wanted to be able to automatically download the issues of a digitised periodical in Trove as PDFs. There was already a notebook in the GLAM Workbench that downloads the issues of a digitised newspaper as PDFs, but newspapers work differently to other digitised periodicals in Trove. While there was no corresponding notebook for other types of periodicals, all the necessary steps were documented in the Trove Data Guide, so it was just a matter of pulling together a few blocks of code.
There are three main steps:
get the nla.obj identifiers for all the periodical’s issues
get the number of pages in each issue
construct a url to download each issue as a PDF using the nla.obj identifier and the number of pages
Get issue identifiers

        <p>This interdisciplinary conference aims to explore the multifaceted roles of sports, culture, and arts in shaping diverse European societies throughout history. By going beyond traditional narratives of labour and economy, we seek to examine how these realms intersect with societal dynamics, identity formation, and community cohesion.
Migration has long served as a conduit for the exchange and diffusion of sporting traditions, artistic expressions, and cultural identities across borders and continents. Similarly, sports, culture and arts serve as powerful mediums through which migrants navigate and negotiate their identities, fostering inclusion among migrant populations. This dynamic exchange between migration and what lies beyond work not only shapes the cultural landscapes of host nations but also enriches the global fabric of human experience.
The annual event is co-organised by the Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations Humaines (CDMH), a long-time AEMI member; the Ville de Dudelange and the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH).

        <p>Many questions are currently being asked about the practice of history: archives are being transformed, tools have changed, as have the logics and players involved in disseminating historical research. How do we choose among the many paths open to us today? The “Taste of the archive in the digital age” project, carried out since 2017 with Frédéric Clavert, aimed in part to describe these new practices of history; it led to a reflection on the nature of the links that bind us to the archive. Certain parts of this documentation have become unstable, such as “family” archives, which have hitherto survived in attics or trunks, and are now flows that disappear at the same time as our smartphones and their photo albums. Around these questions gravitate “worlds”: archivists, the “public”, students, publishers... what specific contributions can historians make in this galaxy?

Christine Roughan is a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Center for Digital Humanities and with Manuscript, Rare Book and Archive Studies. Christine earned her Ph.D. in the Ancient World from New York University in January 2023, where her doctoral work explored a premodern astronomical curriculum and its continued use in Greek and Arabic between the second and thirteenth centuries CE. Christine&#x27;s research applies computational approaches to the study of manuscript transmissions in the Mediterranean world, particularly of mathematical and scientific works. During her postdoctoral term at Princeton, Christine is leveraging deep learning tools to classify and analyze visual data from digitized manuscripts, with a particular focus on paratextual material.
The written outputs of manuscript cultures are often characterized by a degree of multiformity, and certain texts see particularly high amounts of variation. Works used for didactic purposes, for instance, often saw multiple interventions in the hands of contemporary scholars and teachers. While digital imaging initiatives have made great strides in making manuscript materials more accessible, the fact that this data is in image format has until recently presented a speedbump for research that would grapple with such highly variable traditions. But this is changing with the machine learning technologies available today. This talk will explore how these tools can facilitate access at scale into the texts of digitized manuscript collections, as well as support research into material beyond the main text column, whether that material is textual (e.g., marginal annotations) or visual (e.g., scientific diagrams).

What is LOVÓ?

The term LOVÓ combines the words &quot;love&quot; (in English) and &quot;avó&quot; (grandmother in Portuguese) to refer to the memory of the grandmothers of the Portuguese and Cape Verdean community in Esch. Led by Myriam Dalal and Thomas Cauvin, researchers from the University of Luxembourg, this project uses oral history and art to give a voice to several Portuguese-speaking grandmothers residing in Esch-sur-Alzette, who have made this city their home.
LOVÓ explores the personal stories of these remarkable women, weaving a link between the private and public spheres, and between the individual and the collective. These grandmothers play an essential role as bearers of intangible cultural heritage, tran…</p>

The past
Commonwealth Hansard is made available online through ParlInfo (there’s an alternative search interface here). The Parliamentary Library has invested a lot of time and effort in  converting the printed volumes into nicely-structured XML files which break up the sitting day into debates and speeches, and identify individual speakers. For the most part, there’s one XML file for each sitting day in each house. However, there’s currently a gap between 1981 and 1997 where no XML files are available.

August, 2024



El Movimiento Audiovisual en Nuevitas (MAN) hace referencia a la gestión comunitaria (producción, alfabetización audiovisual, exhibición y distribución) que un grupo de jóvenes viene desarrollando en esta localidad desde el año 2007. Esta iniciativa en principio se encuentra deslindada de la institución política-cultural oficial cubana. Responde al concurso de los esfuerzos de sus integrantes y de los pobladores del municipio. En materia de formación profesional artística el núcleo central proviene de las Escuelas de Instructores de Arte en las especialidades de Teatro, Plástica, Música y Danza. La curva de aprendizaje en materia de realización audiovisual se sustenta en la práctica y participación en talleres, conferencias, cursos, festivales y otras experiencias educativa-formativas. Hasta la fecha se han producido alrededor de 100 materiales entre ficciones, documentales, videos musicales, video arte y carteles. Desde el año 2012 organizan la muestra de audiovisuales Hieroscopia con carácter anual. En ella se exhiben tanto las obras producidas por el MAN como de otros espacios de producción comunitaria en Cuba. El encuentro sirve también para el intercambio teórico sobre la práctica audiovisual aprovechando la presencia de realizadores, críticos, periodistas y en general, personal disímil que se dedica a lo cinematográfico en la isla. Por la constancia en el trabajo, la gestión de espacios para la creación y el debate y la vocación por la superación técnica y estética, el MAN se ha convertido en un foco del audiovisual cubano contemporáneo.

        <p>Over the past several decades, great strides have been made to democratize public history. As one of the main cultural sites where public history is engaged, museums play a critical role in not only educating the public, but, increasingly, learning from the public about the past, and its significance in the present and future. Ongoing calls for deeper and more diverse forms of participation, power sharing, and collaboration have brought a wider range of perspectives and participants into the processes of producing history for public engagement. But museum practitioners’ engagement with children often remains stuck in outmoded, hierarchical dynamics that fail to recognize children’s capacities as contributors and collaborators in public historical work.

        <p>If you’re interested in opening up GLAM collections for use in research, you might like to join the new Collections as Data Interest Group, part of the Research Data Alliance.

According to the group description:
This group is aimed at collections  professionals such as archivists, librarians, records managers and  museum curators, as well as related professions such as IT  professionals, knowledge scientists, and those involved in standards  development, who serve in a range of critical roles: as experts in  ensuring access, preservation, and reuse of digital records, objects,  data, and collections; as provocateurs for good collections curation  practices; and as advocates for the construction of responsible and  sustainable infrastructures for information sharing.

        <p>The GLAM Name Index Search brings datasets from 10 Australian GLAM organisations together into a single  search interface. All these datasets index collections by people’s  names, so with one search you can find information about individuals  across a broad range of records, locations, and periods. It was created as an experiment during Family History Week in 2021, so I thought I’d update it for Family History Week 2024.
The update added 18 new datasets, so the GLAM Name Index Search now includes 279 datasets from 10 organisations – almost 12 million rows of data!
Start exploring now!
Most of the datasets come from government open data portals, so the GLAM Name Index Search is also a demonstration the value of data sharing. By making these datasets openly available, GLAM organisations supp…</p>

What is Zotero?
According to the Zotero website:
Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research.
While you can use it instead of commercial reference managers like EndNote, Zotero is much, much more. I use Zotero as my personal research database, capturing publications, websites, PDFs, as well as records from a growing number of GLAM collections. You can add tags and notes to items, organise them into collections, and annotate PDFs and website captures. You can also share your collections, create groups to collaborate with others, and acc…</p>

        <p>Rondo is a predominantly African American neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota, with a familiar story. Across the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, an estimated 1,600 communities of color were destroyed by highway construction. Rondo was one of these neighborhoods, sacrificed to the asphalt as cities across the country weaponized their arteries by building “white roads through Black bedrooms.”
Marvin Anderson remembers what the City of St. Paul did to his neighborhood, and he has made it his life’s mission to Remember Rondo. In 2015, Mr. Anderson and Rebecca Wingo joined forces to create RememberingRondo.org, a vibrant history hub with a community-based digital archive, a map of Rondo’s historic businesses, and much more.

        <p>Archiving has always been about selecting, preserving and making available. But while historians and archivists share a common interest in archived information, their vision of material relevance and record-keeping occasionally differ. Additionally to this ancient divide, digital archiving has brought new challenges for both communities.
In this paper, I will first discuss conceptual continuity lines between analog and digital archiving of textual material at a general level. In a second step, I will examine both analog and digital archiving under the lens of their environmental footprint and the challenges it brings about in a context of resource shortage like the climate and biodiversity crisis. I will not concentrate solely on strategies pertaining to the archived material itself, but w…</p>

Julie Nelson Davis specializes in the arts and material cultures of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Japan, with a focus on prints, paintings, and illustrated books. One of the leaders in the field of ukiyo-e (“images of the floating world”), Davis takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding these works in context, exploring issues related to artistic practice, authorship, gender, and censorship, among others. Selected as a Guggenheim Fellow for 2021, Davis is working on a new project about imitation, homage, and fabrication in ukiyo-e painting as well as second project on artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) and illustrated books.

        <p>Trove contains thousands of digitised maps from the collections of the National Library of Australia, but they’re not always easy to find because of the way they’re arranged and described. To help you explore these maps I’ve created a new database and published it using Datasette.
Try it now!

To get started, head to the map sheets table and search for some keywords. The results are displayed both as a cluster map using Leaflet, and as a table. To view the details of an individual map sheet, click on the id value.

The individual record displays a zoomable version of the map image. If the record includes geospatial coordinates, these are also displayed on a modern basemap. There are also options to download the map image as a JPEG or a high-resolution TIFF (if available). Where possible …</p>

        <p>This conference aims to address the often-overlooked genealogies of digital history and the recurring issue of »blind spots« within the field regarding its own past. Many of the epistemological and methodological questions we face today were already explored by previous generations. These explorations were often accompanied by rhetoric emphasizing the new, revolutionary, and disruptive nature of digital history. Researchers still find it difficult to assess their own achievements from a historical perspective. Our conference seeks to bring together digital historians from diverse contexts and regions to shed light on the history of digital history. While certainly not exhaustive, the conference will focus on the importance of historicizing developments, methods, and practices in digital hi…</p>

        <p>HASS researchers often compile data in spreadsheets. Sometimes they want to ‘publish’ this data online in a form that encourages others to use and explore – but how? I’ve just added a simple tool to the GLAM Workbench that helps you construct a url that will open a CSV file as a searchable database using Datasette-Lite.
What’s Datasette?
Datasette is a fantastic tool that helps you publish your data as an interactive website. There’s a few different varieties of Datasette, but Datasette-Lite is probably the easiest, as you don’t need to install any software. Datasette-Lite runs completely within your web browser, converting your data into into a searchable database on demand.
I’m using Datasette-Lite throughout the GLAM Workbench. For example, try clicking the Explore in Datasette buttons …</p>

        <p>I had to update my sadly-neglected CV, so of course I ended up renovating the whole of my personal website at timsherratt.au.  To start with, I migrated my CV from Pages to Markdown. This made it easy to integrate the CV’s content into the site’s about me page. As i was updating the CV, I tried to get as many as possible of my publications and presentations into Zenodo for easy access and safekeeping. This means that the about me page now has a long list of publications and presentations, dating back more than 20 years, that are (almost) all available online.

While I was fiddling about with the content, I thought I should probably update the theme as well. The site now uses Minimal Mistakes and will display in either dark or light mode depending on your system and browser settings. Hopefully I can ignore it for a few more years now!</p>

        <p>The Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench includes a number of notebooks and datasets that document the context and content of the newspaper corpus. I’ve just updated a few of these datasets:
Total number of issues per year for each newspaper in Trove
Complete list of issues for every newspaper in Trove
Trove newspapers with non-English language content
Trove newspapers with articles published after 1954
OCR corrections in Trove newspapers

I’ve also used the issues data to update my visualisation of the number of digitised newspaper issues in Trove published every day from 1803 to 2021 (there’s a lot of data so it can take a little while to load!).
The notebooks in the Trove newspapers section still need to be updated to work with version 3 of the Trove API. I’m part way through and should get it finished in the next few weeks. I’ll also be adding some more of this data into the Understanding the digitised newspapers section of the Trove Data Guide.</p>

        <p>A fairly intensive period of work came to an end today as I delivered a workshop on ‘Understanding Trove’ at the Australian Historical Association’s annual conference in Adelaide. In effect, the workshop was also the launch of the Trove Data Guide, which I’ve been developing as part of the ARDC’s Community Data Lab. The ARDC sponsored today’s workshop and has provided bursaries to help five ECRs and HDRs participate in the conference’s digital history stream.
Thanks to everyone who came to the workshop. It was great to have so much interest in developing a critical understanding of Trove and thinking about new research uses for Trove data. If you couldn’t make it, the slides are available below. Like the Trove Data Guide, the GLAM Workbench and pretty much everything else I do, the slides are openly licensed so feel free to share and reuse if any of it is useful to you.

Now I think I need a day off before I start thinking about the topics I’d still like to add to the Trove Data Guide…</p>

        <p>While historical video games set in Antiquity tend to focus on military gameplay, economic aspects such as resource exploitation and management have always been a significant part of the ludic depiction of the ancient world, from 4X grand strategy games, to city builders, to action-adventures. The talk takes a closer look at how economy and trade are (mis)represented and utilised in “ancient” video games, from Hamurabi (1973) to Builders of Egypt (2020).
Christian Rollinger is Reader in Ancient History at the University of Trier and currently a Visiting Professor at the University of Potsdam. His research interests include the economic and cultural history of the late Roman republic, the late Roman empire, ancient monarchies generally, and Classical Receptions in modern popular media.

Undergrads expand stories behind historic slavery lawsuits



The handwriting on the screen can be vexing, but the stories are fascinating.
Zoe Williams, a rising sophomore at Howard University in Washington, D.C., carefully read the scrawled words of a 200-year-old document on her computer screen in the Digital Legal Research Lab, a lab in the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Center for Digital Research in the Humanities.
“That is easily the biggest challenge,” Williams said. “You do get used to the handwriting as you go, and some pages are easier than others, but there have been some that look like chicken scratch.”
As the reading started to flow more easily, Williams began to untwine and understand the legal hurdles of an enslaved man named Paul Jones who was seeking…</p>

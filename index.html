Omeka is a content management system (CMS) designed by digital humanists at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. It allows you to create online collections and digital exhibits without knowing any code. Thinking about a tool like Omeka also gives us the opportunity to get into some of the most common questions in DH around maintenance, sustainability, collaboration, labor, digital representation, and the politics of metadata … and probably a few other things too. The goal of the workshop isn’t necessarily to promote Omeka (evene though it is an excellent tool for many applications) but rather to give you the information you need to decide if Omeka is right for you (and if it isn’t, what alternatives there might be).

In this workshop, I will introduce and demo a few very easy to use tools including:
Voyant (easy Text Analysis)
TimelineJS (easy Time Line builder)
StoryMapper (easy interactive maping)
 
I’ll also talk a little about free options for building quick websites. If you’ve already seen me do something like this before, it is unlikely that I will go over anything new so don’t feel compelled to come. On the other hand, if you haven’t seen it, it sounds like people often find it to be useful.

Stephanie Boddie, MSW, PhD, is an Associate Professor of Church and community Ministries at Baylor University, with appointments in their Garland School of Social Work and Truett Seminary. Amy Hillier, MSW, PhD, is an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy &amp; Practice. The two were graduate school classmates at Penn and co-direct a public history project called The Ward: Race and Class in Du Bois’ Seventh Ward. The project aims to teach people about the great civil rights leader and scholar, W.E.B. Du Bois, and his 1899 book, The Philadelphia Negro through research, neighborhood walking tours, a documentary, interactive mapping, a board game, and oral histories. During this presentation, they will describe recent efforts to catalog and extend their project scope. They will demonstrate some of the current content and invite participants to help workshop ideas for their new website and the next phase of this 20-year-old project.

        <p>This lecture first examines historical and contemporary patterns of human and non-human mobilizations that emerge when certain archival collections gain attention—earning archival value—from official institutions, professional archivists, critical scholars, and researchers. In this context, it is essential to consider the distinct intentions of both mainstream and alternative agents involved in these collections. Additionally, the varying motivations, methods, and means of visibly activating and utilizing these archives must be noted. As these dynamics unfold, questions arise concerning the limitations of accessibility, competition over full ownership and representation, and the ongoing debate between quantity and quality in archival practices. Building on my experience with Shubra’s Archive—Egypt’s first neighborhood-based community archive—the second part of the lecture expands on these questions and debates by integrating vernacular archival practices informed and performed by local residents and researchers. The main argument is that the presence of a place that ethnographically archives and engages with its space in the here and now opens up innovative situated ethical, logistical, and social endeavors. These endeavors not only interrogate the value-making processes of archival collections but also highlight the ruses and risks of aspiring toward exhaustive and accessible archives.

        <p>In July 1843, after years of negotiation and resistance, the State of Ohio cast the last Native American tribe from its borders. Though the Wyandot reserved their legal right to remain until 1844, theft and land speculation by white settlers made staying in their homes untenable. Nearly 700 tribal citizens walked 240 kilometers from the Grand Reserve in Upper Sandusky to Cincinnati, Ohio. There, they boarded steamboats bound for unknown, unfamiliar lands in Kansas, over 1,150 kilometers away.
Ohio has forgotten about the Wyandot, as well as the larger story of their Removal and resistance. Wingo began a partnership with the the Cultural Division of the Wyandotte Nation in 2021 to reconstitute the Wyandot(te)’s legacy and repair Ohio’s historical amnesia. Their work consists of two (in-progress) community-based public history projects: the Wyandot Removal Trail and the Wyandot Heritage Digital Archive.
These projects are about reclamation as much as it is about Removal. Ohio, and the Midwest more broadly, mythologizes its past by laying claim to various freedoms: free from tyranny, free from slavery, and since 1843, also free from Indians. In coproducing this project, the Wyandotte are reclaiming control of their history, but how do they ensure the long term sustainability of these important resources?

        <p>The most iconic monsters in modern pop culture, including the vampire, the zombie, Frankenstein’s monster and even the mummy, have been the subject of numerous critical studies that have explored their cultural dimensions – or, in other words, the social, historical and political significance of the narratives in which they appear. The werewolf, on the other hand, has often been reduced to “the beast within,” or a psychoanalytic analogue for the bestial side of man. Phases of the Moon: A Cultural History of the Werewolf Film (2020) redresses the balance by providing wolf men and she-wolves with the same level of cultural analysis as has been afforded to their fellow monsters.
This talk, drawn from Phases of the Moon, will explore the evolution of the werewolf from antiquity to modern cinem…</p>

        <p>What if the Nazis had won World War II? What if J.F. Kennedy had survived the assassination? What if the Cold War had ended in nuclear devastation?
Games often engage with counterfactual history, exploring events that didn’t happen but might have, inviting players to consider not only how different outcomes could have shaped the world we live in today, but also why certain events unfolded the way they did.
For this new appointment with History@Play, the C²DH is proud to once again team up with Rotondes, Game On, and the BTS school of Game Programming and Game Design to explore how video games reimagine the past.
The GRAND SALLE will showcase a selection of video games that reimagine key historical moments and immerse players in alternate histories.
In the STUDIOS, we will present a historical board game workshop in collaboration with the BTS school of Game Programming and Game Design.
Working in teams, the participants will learn the ropes of game design by creating games that explore how different choices could have altered key moments in Luxembourg’s history.

        <p>Visualisation is a great way to find problems in your data.
As part of the Everyday Heritage project, I’m working with a team to document the lives of Tasmania’s Chinese residents in the 19th and early 20th centuries. We’re using a variety of sources such as Trove’s newspapers, the Tasmanian Names Index, and the Tasmanian Post Office Directories. To help with the research, I converted all the PDF volumes of the Post Office Directories into a public, online, searchable database. Or at least, I thought I had.
The Tasmanian Post Office Directories database embeds metadata about each line of text in its results, so it’s easy to save items of interest using Zotero. A member of our team has already saved hundreds of entries this way. The other day I started pulling these entries out of Zotero us…</p>

        <p>Dr. Inna Ganschow’s presentation is a nuanced reconstruction of the historical events concerning Soviet forced laborers in Luxembourg during World War II. The talk will present research findings that will be published in a monograph in 2024 answering the research question: ‘What were the living and working conditions of Soviet forced laborers in Luxembourg during World War II, as seen from German, American, and Soviet documentation, and what impact did these experiences have on their lives after their return?’ The internal seminar for C²DH is especially informative since several camps for young civilians from Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, as well as for Soviet prisoners of war, were located on the Belval University campus, which is situated on the site of the former ARBED steelworks using the forced labor during WWII.

        <p>To understand the internet, one must understand advertising. But what is advertising, exactly? Is it simply a way to inform consumers about products and services? Is it large companies gathering consumer data? Hidden technologies for tracking and profiling? Public policies regulating data markets or leaving them unfettered?
Advertising is all these things and more. In this talk, Matthew Crain will outline a political economic approach to advertising, foregrounding the concepts of social relations and structural power.
 
About the lecturer

          <h3>Major update for the Trove Newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>
        </a>
        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://updates.timsherratt.org/>Tim Sherratt</a> |
          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>The Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench was updated last week. Over the last year I’ve been gradually updating notebooks to use version 3 of the Trove API, but when version 2 suddenly disappeared a couple of weeks ago I had to hurriedly pull everything together. The Trove newspapers section includes 23 notebooks and 6 datasets, so it’s not a small job. The changes include:
updated all notebooks to use version 3 of the Trove API
removed remaining datasets from the code repository and created dedicated data repositories for them, integrating them with Zenodo where appropriate
added metadata to all the notebooks – this is used to build an RO-Crate metadata file for the code repository
updated all the Python packages
added a voila.json file to configure Voilá
None of the functionality of the notebooks should have changed. There’s a slight difference in the Finding non-English newspapers in Trove notebook because the language detection library I was using is no longer maintained. I’ve swapped in py3langid and it seems to work well, though the results are a little different. Interestingly, where the previous library thought that bad OCR was ‘Maltese’, the new one detects it as ‘Latin’! There’s no change to the list of newspapers with non-English language content detected by the notebook.

The documentation pages have also been updated. The notebook pages are now built using data from the code repository’s RO-Crate file. They also include embedded HTML previews of the notebooks. If a notebook generates visualisations, the visualisations are usually included in the HTML, so you can explore the outputs without running the notebook – see, for example, the charts in Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state. Most of the dataset pages now include links to explore the contents using Datasette-Lite.
I still have to generate RO-Crate files for all the data repositories, but I wanted to get the code stuff finished first.</p>

        <p>It’s pretty obvious that access to digitised resources, like Trove’s newspapers, has changed the practice of history in Australia. But how? I’m certain that the historiographical implications of the growth and development of online collections will become a topic of increasing interest to historians, and that exploration of this topic will lead to important insights into the relationship between what we keep, what we value, and what we know. But for this to happen we need to have data documenting changes in online collections. What became available when? How was it delivered to users? How did the search indexing work?
In general, GLAM collection interfaces exist in an eternal present – they’re not good at explaining changes, or communicating their own histories. Australian GLAM organisatio…</p>

Dr. Tajah Ebram will talk about her current work with The Black Bibliography Project (BBP). The BBP is creating a digital database of Black book history with the aim of revealing the dynamic social networks and aesthetic practices specific to Black print cultures in the U.S.  During her talk, she will discuss her background in Black literary and cultural studies and how this informs her current work with the BBP. Her current research with the project is focused on developing and curating, in collaboration with graduate researchers, a corpus centering the print cultures of books authored by incarcerated Black writers and organizers of the late 20th century. The talk will explore the print cultures of Black prison movements while also attending to critical political, ethical and descriptive considerations involved in developing data about these works and writers. 

Dr. Tajah Ebram is a cultural historian, teacher and community memory worker. She is currently the Black Studies Librarian at Rutgers University New Brunswick and the Rutgers lead for the Black Bibliography Project. Prior to her work at Rutgers, she was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Haverford College where she developed seminars around Black feminisms, carceral studies and Black environmentalism.  In 2020, she completed her PhD in English at the University of Pennsylvania where she focused on Philly Black freedom movements through the lenses of oral history, digital storytelling, and material culture.

        <p>I was recently contacted by a researcher who wanted to be able to automatically download the issues of a digitised periodical in Trove as PDFs. There was already a notebook in the GLAM Workbench that downloads the issues of a digitised newspaper as PDFs, but newspapers work differently to other digitised periodicals in Trove. While there was no corresponding notebook for other types of periodicals, all the necessary steps were documented in the Trove Data Guide, so it was just a matter of pulling together a few blocks of code.
There are three main steps:
get the nla.obj identifiers for all the periodical’s issues
get the number of pages in each issue
construct a url to download each issue as a PDF using the nla.obj identifier and the number of pages
Get issue identifiers

        <p>This interdisciplinary conference aims to explore the multifaceted roles of sports, culture, and arts in shaping diverse European societies throughout history. By going beyond traditional narratives of labour and economy, we seek to examine how these realms intersect with societal dynamics, identity formation, and community cohesion.
Migration has long served as a conduit for the exchange and diffusion of sporting traditions, artistic expressions, and cultural identities across borders and continents. Similarly, sports, culture and arts serve as powerful mediums through which migrants navigate and negotiate their identities, fostering inclusion among migrant populations. This dynamic exchange between migration and what lies beyond work not only shapes the cultural landscapes of host nations but also enriches the global fabric of human experience.
The annual event is co-organised by the Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations Humaines (CDMH), a long-time AEMI member; the Ville de Dudelange and the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH).

        <p>Many questions are currently being asked about the practice of history: archives are being transformed, tools have changed, as have the logics and players involved in disseminating historical research. How do we choose among the many paths open to us today? The “Taste of the archive in the digital age” project, carried out since 2017 with Frédéric Clavert, aimed in part to describe these new practices of history; it led to a reflection on the nature of the links that bind us to the archive. Certain parts of this documentation have become unstable, such as “family” archives, which have hitherto survived in attics or trunks, and are now flows that disappear at the same time as our smartphones and their photo albums. Around these questions gravitate “worlds”: archivists, the “public”, students, publishers... what specific contributions can historians make in this galaxy?

Christine Roughan is a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Center for Digital Humanities and with Manuscript, Rare Book and Archive Studies. Christine earned her Ph.D. in the Ancient World from New York University in January 2023, where her doctoral work explored a premodern astronomical curriculum and its continued use in Greek and Arabic between the second and thirteenth centuries CE. Christine&#x27;s research applies computational approaches to the study of manuscript transmissions in the Mediterranean world, particularly of mathematical and scientific works. During her postdoctoral term at Princeton, Christine is leveraging deep learning tools to classify and analyze visual data from digitized manuscripts, with a particular focus on paratextual material.
The written outputs of manuscript cultures are often characterized by a degree of multiformity, and certain texts see particularly high amounts of variation. Works used for didactic purposes, for instance, often saw multiple interventions in the hands of contemporary scholars and teachers. While digital imaging initiatives have made great strides in making manuscript materials more accessible, the fact that this data is in image format has until recently presented a speedbump for research that would grapple with such highly variable traditions. But this is changing with the machine learning technologies available today. This talk will explore how these tools can facilitate access at scale into the texts of digitized manuscript collections, as well as support research into material beyond the main text column, whether that material is textual (e.g., marginal annotations) or visual (e.g., scientific diagrams).

        <p>The LOVÓ project is part of the programme of the Biennale 2024 Esch capitale culturelle.

 
What is LOVÓ?

The term LOVÓ combines the words &quot;love&quot; (in English) and &quot;avó&quot; (grandmother in Portuguese) to refer to the memory of the grandmothers of the Portuguese and Cape Verdean community in Esch. Led by Myriam Dalal and Thomas Cauvin, researchers from the University of Luxembourg, this project uses oral history and art to give a voice to several Portuguese-speaking grandmothers residing in Esch-sur-Alzette, who have made this city their home.
LOVÓ explores the personal stories of these remarkable women, weaving a link between the private and public spheres, and between the individual and the collective. These grandmothers play an essential role as bearers of intangible cultural heritage, tran…</p>

The past
Commonwealth Hansard is made available online through ParlInfo (there’s an alternative search interface here). The Parliamentary Library has invested a lot of time and effort in  converting the printed volumes into nicely-structured XML files which break up the sitting day into debates and speeches, and identify individual speakers. For the most part, there’s one XML file for each sitting day in each house. However, there’s currently a gap between 1981 and 1997 where no XML files are available.

August, 2024



El Movimiento Audiovisual en Nuevitas (MAN) hace referencia a la gestión comunitaria (producción, alfabetización audiovisual, exhibición y distribución) que un grupo de jóvenes viene desarrollando en esta localidad desde el año 2007. Esta iniciativa en principio se encuentra deslindada de la institución política-cultural oficial cubana. Responde al concurso de los esfuerzos de sus integrantes y de los pobladores del municipio. En materia de formación profesional artística el núcleo central proviene de las Escuelas de Instructores de Arte en las especialidades de Teatro, Plástica, Música y Danza. La curva de aprendizaje en materia de realización audiovisual se sustenta en la práctica y participación en talleres, conferencias, cursos, festivales y otras experiencias educativa-formativas. Hasta la fecha se han producido alrededor de 100 materiales entre ficciones, documentales, videos musicales, video arte y carteles. Desde el año 2012 organizan la muestra de audiovisuales Hieroscopia con carácter anual. En ella se exhiben tanto las obras producidas por el MAN como de otros espacios de producción comunitaria en Cuba. El encuentro sirve también para el intercambio teórico sobre la práctica audiovisual aprovechando la presencia de realizadores, críticos, periodistas y en general, personal disímil que se dedica a lo cinematográfico en la isla. Por la constancia en el trabajo, la gestión de espacios para la creación y el debate y la vocación por la superación técnica y estética, el MAN se ha convertido en un foco del audiovisual cubano contemporáneo.

        <p>Over the past several decades, great strides have been made to democratize public history. As one of the main cultural sites where public history is engaged, museums play a critical role in not only educating the public, but, increasingly, learning from the public about the past, and its significance in the present and future. Ongoing calls for deeper and more diverse forms of participation, power sharing, and collaboration have brought a wider range of perspectives and participants into the processes of producing history for public engagement. But museum practitioners’ engagement with children often remains stuck in outmoded, hierarchical dynamics that fail to recognize children’s capacities as contributors and collaborators in public historical work. Very few museum institutions engage w…</p>

        <p>The GLAM Name Index Search brings datasets from 10 Australian GLAM organisations together into a single  search interface. All these datasets index collections by people’s  names, so with one search you can find information about individuals  across a broad range of records, locations, and periods. It was created as an experiment during Family History Week in 2021, so I thought I’d update it for Family History Week 2024.
The update added 18 new datasets, so the GLAM Name Index Search now includes 279 datasets from 10 organisations – almost 12 million rows of data!
Start exploring now!
Most of the datasets come from government open data portals, so the GLAM Name Index Search is also a demonstration the value of data sharing. By making these datasets openly available, GLAM organisations supp…</p>

What is Zotero?
According to the Zotero website:
Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research.
While you can use it instead of commercial reference managers like EndNote, Zotero is much, much more. I use Zotero as my personal research database, capturing publications, websites, PDFs, as well as records from a growing number of GLAM collections. You can add tags and notes to items, organise them into collections, and annotate PDFs and website captures. You can also share your collections, create groups to collaborate with others, and acc…</p>

        <p>Rondo is a predominantly African American neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota, with a familiar story. Across the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, an estimated 1,600 communities of color were destroyed by highway construction. Rondo was one of these neighborhoods, sacrificed to the asphalt as cities across the country weaponized their arteries by building “white roads through Black bedrooms.”
Marvin Anderson remembers what the City of St. Paul did to his neighborhood, and he has made it his life’s mission to Remember Rondo. In 2015, Mr. Anderson and Rebecca Wingo joined forces to create RememberingRondo.org, a vibrant history hub with a community-based digital archive, a map of Rondo’s historic businesses, and much more.

        <p>Archiving has always been about selecting, preserving and making available. But while historians and archivists share a common interest in archived information, their vision of material relevance and record-keeping occasionally differ. Additionally to this ancient divide, digital archiving has brought new challenges for both communities.
In this paper, I will first discuss conceptual continuity lines between analog and digital archiving of textual material at a general level. In a second step, I will examine both analog and digital archiving under the lens of their environmental footprint and the challenges it brings about in a context of resource shortage like the climate and biodiversity crisis. I will not concentrate solely on strategies pertaining to the archived material itself, but w…</p>

Julie Nelson Davis specializes in the arts and material cultures of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Japan, with a focus on prints, paintings, and illustrated books. One of the leaders in the field of ukiyo-e (“images of the floating world”), Davis takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding these works in context, exploring issues related to artistic practice, authorship, gender, and censorship, among others. Selected as a Guggenheim Fellow for 2021, Davis is working on a new project about imitation, homage, and fabrication in ukiyo-e painting as well as second project on artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) and illustrated books.

        <p>This conference aims to address the often-overlooked genealogies of digital history and the recurring issue of »blind spots« within the field regarding its own past.

        <p>HASS researchers often compile data in spreadsheets. Sometimes they want to ‘publish’ this data online in a form that encourages others to use and explore – but how? I’ve just added a simple tool to the GLAM Workbench that helps you construct a url that will open a CSV file as a searchable database using Datasette-Lite.
What’s Datasette?
Datasette is a fantastic tool that helps you publish your data as an interactive website. There’s a few different varieties of Datasette, but Datasette-Lite is probably the easiest, as you don’t need to install any software. Datasette-Lite runs completely within your web browser, converting your data into into a searchable database on demand.
I’m using Datasette-Lite throughout the GLAM Workbench. For example, try clicking the Explore in Datasette buttons …</p>

        <p>I had to update my sadly-neglected CV, so of course I ended up renovating the whole of my personal website at timsherratt.au.  To start with, I migrated my CV from Pages to Markdown. This made it easy to integrate the CV’s content into the site’s about me page. As i was updating the CV, I tried to get as many as possible of my publications and presentations into Zenodo for easy access and safekeeping. This means that the about me page now has a long list of publications and presentations, dating back more than 20 years, that are (almost) all available online.

While I was fiddling about with the content, I thought I should probably update the theme as well. The site now uses Minimal Mistakes and will display in either dark or light mode depending on your system and browser settings. Hopefully I can ignore it for a few more years now!</p>

        <p>The Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench includes a number of notebooks and datasets that document the context and content of the newspaper corpus. I’ve just updated a few of these datasets:
Total number of issues per year for each newspaper in Trove
Complete list of issues for every newspaper in Trove
Trove newspapers with non-English language content
Trove newspapers with articles published after 1954
OCR corrections in Trove newspapers

I’ve also used the issues data to update my visualisation of the number of digitised newspaper issues in Trove published every day from 1803 to 2021 (there’s a lot of data so it can take a little while to load!).
The notebooks in the Trove newspapers section still need to be updated to work with version 3 of the Trove API. I’m part way through and should get it finished in the next few weeks. I’ll also be adding some more of this data into the Understanding the digitised newspapers section of the Trove Data Guide.</p>

        <p>A fairly intensive period of work came to an end today as I delivered a workshop on ‘Understanding Trove’ at the Australian Historical Association’s annual conference in Adelaide. In effect, the workshop was also the launch of the Trove Data Guide, which I’ve been developing as part of the ARDC’s Community Data Lab. The ARDC sponsored today’s workshop and has provided bursaries to help five ECRs and HDRs participate in the conference’s digital history stream.
Thanks to everyone who came to the workshop. It was great to have so much interest in developing a critical understanding of Trove and thinking about new research uses for Trove data. If you couldn’t make it, the slides are available below. Like the Trove Data Guide, the GLAM Workbench and pretty much everything else I do, the slides are openly licensed so feel free to share and reuse if any of it is useful to you.

Now I think I need a day off before I start thinking about the topics I’d still like to add to the Trove Data Guide…</p>

        <p>While historical video games set in Antiquity tend to focus on military gameplay, economic aspects such as resource exploitation and management have always been a significant part of the ludic depiction of the ancient world, from 4X grand strategy games, to city builders, to action-adventures. The talk takes a closer look at how economy and trade are (mis)represented and utilised in “ancient” video games, from Hamurabi (1973) to Builders of Egypt (2020).
Christian Rollinger is Reader in Ancient History at the University of Trier and currently a Visiting Professor at the University of Potsdam. His research interests include the economic and cultural history of the late Roman republic, the late Roman empire, ancient monarchies generally, and Classical Receptions in modern popular media.

        <p>The Trove Data Guide aims to help researchers understand, access, and use data from Trove. But just because it’s about ‘data’ doesn’t mean  you need to be able to code. To understand Trove data and its  possibilities for research, you first need to understand Trove itself –  its history, its structure, its assumptions, and its limits. This  knowledge is useful to any Trove user.
For example, all Trove users would benefit from knowing more about works and versions, or how to use the ‘simple’ search box for complex queries. There’s also an introduction to what’s in (and not in) the digitised newspapers, and similar overviews for other digitised content such as books, parliamentary papers, and oral histories.

Number of newspapers articles in Trove by publication year, showing the change from 2011 to 2022
Several sections document the way the web interface works (or doesn’t work). There’s a field guide to the various interfaces and identifiers you might come across, and details of options for downloading data. The Trove Data Guide fills many gaps in the official Trove  documentation, so check here if you run into problems, or can’t figure  out how to achieve a particular task. Perhaps you were wondering how to download digitised images at their highest available resolution?
For people who are more comfortable with code there are plenty of  useful snippets and complete working examples. For example there are  sections that document how to get metadata, text, and images from newspapers, and other digitised resources. There are also a series of ‘HOW TO’ pages that describe more complex data access methods.
But what can you do with Trove data? The Trove Data Guide’s Pathways provide detailed tutorials that lead you step by step through examples  of packaging Trove data for use with other digital tools. Use these  examples as a starting point in planning your own projects.</p>

        <p>For this part of the ARDC’s Community Data Lab project, I’ve been focusing in particular on adding a series of researcher pathways to the Trove Data Guide. These pathways link data from Trove to a variety of tools and approaches and include five detailed tutorials. The first four were:
Analysing keywords in Trove’s digitised newspapers
Working with a Trove collection in Tropy
Comparing manuscript collections in Mirador
Sharing a Trove List as a CollectionBuilder exhibition
I’ve now added the fifth and final (for now) tutorial:
Create a layer in the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Placenames using metadata from Trove’s digitised maps
As has been the way in a lot of TDG development, this tutorial builds on and extends resources available through the GLAM Workbench. The Trove maps section of the GLAM Workbench already included a dataset of digitised maps and their coordinates, but for this tutorial I added a notebook that lets you create a subset of maps relating to a particular region. It does this by putting all the available map locations on world map. You then draw a rectangle on the map to select a region and display details of all the maps whose centre points fall within that region. It also displays links to download your new dataset as either a CSV or GeoJSON file.

The tutorial walks you through this process, then demonstrates how you can upload data from the CSV file to create a new layer in the Gazetteer of Historical Australian Placenames (GHAP).

This part of the Trove Data Guide project is now finished, but I’ll be continuing to add and refine content. If you have any suggestions for additional tutorials, feel free to add them to the ideas board (no promises though!).</p>

Undergrads expand stories behind historic slavery lawsuits



The handwriting on the screen can be vexing, but the stories are fascinating.
Zoe Williams, a rising sophomore at Howard University in Washington, D.C., carefully read the scrawled words of a 200-year-old document on her computer screen in the Digital Legal Research Lab, a lab in the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Center for Digital Research in the Humanities.
“That is easily the biggest challenge,” Williams said. “You do get used to the handwriting as you go, and some pages are easier than others, but there have been some that look like chicken scratch.”
As the reading started to flow more easily, Williams began to untwine and understand the legal hurdles of an enslaved man named Paul Jones who was seeking…</p>

          <h3>Probing the Limits of Visualization: From Holocaust Comics to Holocaust Memes and Beyond<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

        <p>Taking a new generation of Holocaust comics as a point of departure, the lecture seeks to historicize different strategies of Holocaust visualization within their respective media ecological contexts. I am particularly interested in exploring the interaction between the structural affordances of analogue, electronic, and digital media and their respective political-normative settings. More specifically, I would like to test the hypothesis that technological and social transformations have prompted key institutions and stake holders to redefine the limits of Holocaust representation inadvertently setting Holocaust memory on a path of reduced visibility.

        <p>Rap Lyrics Corpora: Comparing Tools, Merging Data and Presenting in Paris

            
By Alena Němcová Polická
Since February 2023, preparations have been underway to reshape the RapCor database of the DIGITALIA MUNI ARTS infrastructure - a local node of LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ - to enable long-term storage in order to open access to research data and to create a new repository system for francophone rap albums and lyrics. The specificity of the project lies in the fact that it is not only a database of linguistic data on French (focused mainly on the collection, morpho-semantic and lexicographic description of substandard expressions and on the lemmatisation of graphically unstable sociolectisms and dynamically evolving neologisms), but also a repository of dematerialised musical media for th…</p>

        <p>You’ve been collecting and annotating items relating to your research  project in a Trove List. You’d like to display the contents of your list as an online exhibition for others to explore. But how? One possible approach is now documented in the Trove Data Guide. I’ve added a tutorial which walks through the process of using a GLAM Workbench notebook to extract and process data from a Trove List, before uploading it to CollectionBuilder to create an instant exhibition.

CollectionBuilder creates online exhibitions using static web technologies. It provides a GitHub Pages template repository, so all you need to do to create an exhibition is upload your metadata and images to GitHub. The GLAM Workbench notebook gets your list data from the Trove API, and enriches it a bit to take advantage of CollectionBuilder’s built-in visualisations. For example, if there’s any digitised maps in your list, the notebook will try and extract their coordinates from the digitised map viewer and add them to the metadata so that CollectionViewer can display the location on a map. The notebook also downloads images of newspaper articles and other digitsed resources, and links them to the metadata, ready for upload.

A recently developed topic modelling tool has not only proven to be versatile in terms of its potential applications, but has also been used as a way to introduce less technical SSH scholars to digital methods. The tool, Topics2Themes, was developed by Maria Skeppstedt in collaboration with several researchers, including colleagues from the Swedish CLARIN node at the government agency Institute for Language and Folklore (Isof).

        <p>Au Portugal, il y a 50 ans, le 25 avril 1974, de jeunes officiers, soutenus par une grande partie de la population, renversaient l’Estado Novo, régime autoritaire mis en place par António de Oliveira Salazar en 1933. La fin de cette dictature de près de 40 ans signera également l’arrêt de mort d’un empire colonial européen majeur. Trop souvent réduite à un coup d’État pacifique qui ne dure que quelques heures, la Révolution des Œillets et ses conséquences (décolonisation, mobilisations sociales, quête d’une voie socialiste originale) sont encore mal connues.

        <p>There’s a new draft tutorial in the development version of the Trove Data Guide. It walks through the process of harvesting a collection of digitised newspaper articles from Trove, reshaping the harvest to create sub-collections, and then loading the data into the Keyword Analysis Tool provided by the Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP).

Along the way it goes into a fair bit of detail about constructing searches, using the Trove Newspaper Harvester, and thinking about your data. Much of the information on creating and reshaping datasets would apply to using the digitised newspapers with other analysis tools as well.</p>

        <p>I’ve just created a GitHub repository template that you can use to get your own Mirador version 3 installation running in minutes. You can also configure it to display local or remote IIIF manifests. I was thinking that it could be useful for researchers who want to create their own customised Mirador workspaces to examine a particular set of documents, but don’t want to install any software or fiddle about on the command-line.

I’ve been doing a lot with IIIF lately. First a GLAM Workbench notebook to save a collection of images from Trove as an IIIF manifest. Then a tutorial for the Trove Data Guide that walks through the whole process of generating an IIIF manifest from Trove, then loading the manifest into Tropy for analysis and annotation. I’ve also just about finished another tutori…</p>

        <p>Kiara is the data orchestration engine developed by the DHARPA project with a goal of re-thinking the “black boxes” of historical research. It uses a modular approach to let users re-use tried and tested analytical workflows, as well as create new ones from existing building blocks. It also helps you manage your research data, and augment it with automatically-, semi-automatically-, and manually- created metadata.

        <p>In his proposal for the Dartmouth summer research project (1955-1956), Nathaniel Rochester wondered whether injecting some randomness into a machine could make it creative. But how to control this randomness to prevent machines crashing and ensure the generated content’s relevance ? Seventy years later, the so-called « generative AI » seems to have solved the problem, or at least circumvented some obstacles. Despite the difficulty of estimating what goes on inside deep neural networks, we will briefly describe what « creativity » is about in generative AIs (interpolation in a latent space) and the current controversy over how to evaluate it using dedicated benchmarks. Then, drawing from literature and philosophy (Borges, Caillois, Bachelard), we will challenge the claim that it can be compared to human creativity. Finally, we will examine how these machines don’t have to be creative like humans to trigger an epochal change that we need to characterize.

        <p>Hey Australian Hansard fans, I’ve done a complete reharvest of all of the Commonwealth Hansard XML files from 1901 to 1980 from ParlInfo. There’s been lots of improvements/corrections, and most of the file names have changed (they now have a version flag). The improvements seem to be ongoing, so I’ll try to harvest more regularly from now on. You can download the lot from the GitHub repository.
I still need to load the updated XML into the Historic Hansard site, but that’s going to have to wait  for a month or two…</p>

        <p>I’ve just added a couple of new notebooks to the Trove Newspaper &amp; Gazette Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench.
Using the Trove Harvester as a Python package provides a basic example of using the trove-newspaper-harvester Python package. While there’s already a simple web app version of the harvester, I wanted a notebook version running in the JupyterLab interface that I could integrate with other tools and notebooks. All you need to do to harvest all the articles in a Trove newspaper search is paste in your Trove API key and the search query url from the Trove web interface.

Reshaping your newspaper harvest provides a slice and dice wonder tool for Trove newspaper harvests, enabling you to repackage OCRd text by decade, year, and  newspaper title. It saves the results as zip files, concatenated text files, or CSV files with embedded text. These repackaged slices should  suit a variety of text analysis tools and questions. I’ve be thinking about doing something like this for a while, and think it should be quite useful.
In my usual way, I started off writing a tutorial for the Trove Data Guide on ways of loading digitised newspaper data into text analysis tools and then realised I needed these notebooks to fill in some gaps in the data processing pipeline. So after a day or two of yak shaving I now have to get back to the tutorial.</p>

        <p>Do we play video games or do video games play us? Is nonhuman play a mere paradox or the future of gaming? And what do video games have to do with quantum theory? In the talk based on her book Playing at a Distance (MIT Press 2022), Sonia Fizek will engage with these questions, proposing new ways to think about games and play that decenter the human player and explore a variety of play formats and practices that require surprisingly little human action. Idling in clicker games, wandering in walking simulators, automating gameplay with bots, or simply watching games rather than playing them—Fizek will argue that these seemingly marginal cases are central to understanding how we play in the digital age.

Sonia Fizek is a media and games scholar. She holds a professorship in Media and Game Studies at the Cologne Game Lab at TH Köln – University of Applied Sciences. Fizek is also a visiting professor at the University of Lower Silesia in Wroclaw (Poland)  and a co-editor-in-chief of the international Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds. In her latest book Playing at a Distance (MIT Press 2022), she explores the borderlands of video game aesthetic with focus on automation, AI and posthuman forms of play. Fizek’s current research concentrates on the environmental aspects of video games. She participates in two international projects: “STRATEGIES – Sustainable Transition for Europe’s Game Industries” (2024-2027), and “Greening Games. Building Higher Education Resources for Sustainable Video Game Production, Design &amp; Critical Game Studies” (2021-2024).

        <p>Entreprendre une histoire des inégalités pour un petit pays transnational, caractérisé par le secret fiscal et la consultation après un délai de 100 ans des données fiscales, invite à analyser sur le temps long, les sources et archives en présence : recensements, listes électorales, archives notariales, cadastres, journaux, enquêtes, statistiques, rapports d’observatoires, d’associations, d’institutions comme les archives de Chambres professionnelles.
Toutes ces sources fournissent des informations sur divers espaces, acteurs et groupes sociaux, et contribuent à évaluer la répartition des richesses, les conditions de vie, les écarts de revenus, les privilèges et discriminations.

        <p>Last week I added a notebook to the GLAM Workbench that saves a collection of images from Trove as an IIIF manifest. This week I’ve written a tutorial that shows how you can use the notebook to load the collection data in Tropy – a desktop tool for managing and annotating images for research.

This is the first tutorial in the Trove Data Guide’s Research Pathways section. While most of the TDG documents the types of data available in Trove and how you can access it, the pathways aim to connect Trove data with other tools and platforms – to point at possibilities for analysis, enrichment, and sharing. For example, I’m planning tutorials on packaging OCRd text from Trove for use with text analysis tools, as well as ways of sharing selected data through tools like CollectionBuilder, and Datasette.
If you have any ideas for additional tutorials, feel free to add them to the ideas board in GitHub.</p>

        <p>The Family of Man was an exhibition of some five hundred photographs from around the world, curated by Edward Steichen for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York in 1955. After its installation at MoMA, and under the auspices of the United States Information Agency, copies of the exhibition then toured close to fifty countries. By the end of its international tour the exhibition had been seen by almost ten million people, making it the most successful event of the early decades of the cultural Cold War. This paper will consider the international reception of The Family of Man. Taking India and Japan as case studies, it will suggest the ways in which intersection of Steichen’s work and conception with local social and political circumstances inflected and reshaped the meanings of the exhibition.

        <p>I’ve just added a new notebook to the Trove images section of the GLAM Workbench. It helps you save a collection of digitised images as an IIIF manifest. But what does that mean? It means the notebook packages up all the metadata describing the images in a standard form that can be used with a variety of IIIF-compliant tools. These tools let you do things with the collections that you can’t do in Trove’s own interface.
Perhaps you’d like to browse the complete digitised contents of Sir Edmund Barton’s manuscript collection, without all the back and forth and up and down navigation imposed by the Trove web interface. Here you go, thanks to IIIF!

        <p>There’s a brand new section of the GLAM Workbench to help you use data from Pandora’s collection of archived websites.
What’s Pandora?
Pandora is an initiative of the National Library of Australia which has been selecting web sites and online resources for preservation since 1996. It’s assembled a collection of more than 80,000 archived website titles, organised into subjects and collections.

        <p>Digitised resources in Trove are sometimes grouped into collections – an album of photographs, a set of posters, a bundle of letters. I’ve just added a notebook to the GLAM Workbench that downloads all the images in a collection at the highest available resolution.

A sample of the 3,048 posters download from nla.obj-2590804313
Why is it necessary?
Trove’s digitised collection viewer includes a download option. But in most cases that seems to be limited to downloading 20 images at a time. Part of the reason for that is probably because the images are zipped up into a single file, which could get very large if 100, or 200 images were added.
Another limitation of the built-in download option is that the images are often fairly low resolution copies (many have a maximum width of 1000px). The…</p>

        <p>&#x27;Biographies of Struggle&#x27; is a documentary on a drawn-out unrest that took place at the ThyssenKrupp-AST-Terni steelworks in Central Italy in 2014, one of the longest steelworkers’ strike in Italy since the last wave of labour unrest in the ‘80s. Threatened by 550 job cuts and a partial closure, the Terni factory is the framework in which 11 participants express their discordant thoughts and opinions about the ongoing 7-months-long dispute, and 45-days-long strike. Drawing on their biographies and work experiences, the protagonists depict a fragmented portrait of one of the oldest Italian working class communities, while fighting mass layoffs.
This documentary is inscribed in an ethnographic research which addresses the ways in which labour activism contributes to the articulation of worki…</p>

Au carrefour de la France, de la Belgique et de l’Allemagne, on estime actuellement que près de 5.000 personnes considérées comme juives y vivaient avant l’invasion allemande du 10 mai 1940 ; d’après l’état actuel des recherches, 1.227 sont mortes après avoir été déportées de Luxembourg, Belgique et France ; moins de 1.000 revinrent après la guerre au Luxembourg.

The metadata of these online museum objects can be used as data to analyse the development of concepts, events or technological and social innovations in history by using information retrieval, quantitative and machine learning methods. They can also be used as primary sources to trace the history of and changes in the representation of concepts or events and their interpretation. How do online museum catalogue data reflect multiple perspectives on specific topics?

Players explore scenarios inspired by real-life historical events, and are given the chance to make crucial decisions and potentially rewrite history. World balance depends on the players’ ability to navigate diplomatic crises and maintain peace.

The signing of an agreement between the Jewish Consistory and the State of Luxembourg on January 27, 2021, marked a key moment in the launch of provenance research in the country&#x27;s major cultural institutions.

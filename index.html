This impact story shines the spotlight on one of the initiatives in response to the invasion of Ukraine that CLARIN has supported. The distance learning course ‘Ukrainian History’ was developed by two friends and colleagues, based in Ukraine and Lithuania, as an example of collaboration between EU universities and Ukrainian researchers. The short distant learning course covers the history of Ukraine and its statehood, beginning with the Kyivan Rus’ state and its Ukrainian principalities (9th-13th c.) and then traces Ukraine’s historical development and its struggle for independence until the present day.

        <p>Introduction: Folgert Karsdorp, Mike Kestemont and Allen Riddell ‘s  interactive book, Humanities Data Analysis: Case Studies with Python had been written with the aim in mind to equip humanities students and scholars working with textual and tabular resources with practical, hands-on knowledge to better understand the potentials of data-rich, computer-assisted approaches that the Python framework offers to them and eventually to apply and integrate them to their own research projects.

The first part introduces a “Data carpentry”, a collection of essential techniques for gathering, cleaning, representing, and transforming textual and tabular data. This sets the stage for the second part that consists of 5 case studies (Statistics Essentials: WhoReads Novels? ; Introduction to Probability ; Narrating with Maps ; Stylometry and the Voice of Hildegard ; A Topic Model of United States Supreme Court Opinions, 1900–2000 ) showcasing how to draw meaningful insights from data using quantitative methods. Each chapter contains executable Python codes and ends with exercises ranging from easier drills to more creative and complex possibilities to adapt the apply and adopt the newly acquired knowledge to their own research problems.

The book exhibits best practices in how to make digital scholarship available in an open, sustainable ad digital-native manner, coming in different layers that are firmly interlinked with each other. Published with Princeton University Press in 2021, hardcopies are also available, but more importantly, the digital version is an  Open Access Jupyter notebook that can be read in multiple environments and formats (.md and .pdf). The documentation, coda and data materials are available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/3560761#.Y3tCcn3MJD9). The authors also made sure to select and use packages which are mature and actively maintained.</p>

        <p>The Australian History Industry was published recently. Edited by Paul Ashton and Paula Hamilton, the book ‘explores the complex, multi-roomed house of Australian history’, exploring academic, school, and public history, the impact of digital technologies, and the relationship of history to memory, social justice, politics, and cultural practice.
My chapter ‘Digital revolutions: The limits and affordances of online collections’ looks at how digitisation of GLAM collections has (and hasn’t) changed historical practice:
As the COVID lockdowns in 2020 emphasised, the online availability of  primary source materials makes historical research possible even when  access to the originals is limited. But the undoubted convenience of  being able to browse 200 years worth of newspapers at home masks other  issues that historians have been slow to acknowledge and address. How do we discover relevant resources? What gets digitised and why? How can  researchers use these collections to ask new types of questions? After more than 25 years, the web has its own history. What problems and  possibilities has it brought to the way we understand the past?
It’s available as a green open access preprint on Zenodo.</p>

An Archive that is intelligent, self-aware, and even sentient. One that can write its own story without historians and scholars dawdling in its dusty entrails. From card catalogues</p>

The SSH Open Marketplace is a discovery portal which pools and contextualises resources for social sciences and humanities research communities: tools, services, training materials, datasets, publications and workflows. This service was developed in the context of the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud project (2019-2022) and was delivered to the public by the end of the project in April 2022. Since then, an Editorial Board ensures the day-to-day maintenance and the data quality of the SSH Open Marketplace.

        <p>The deportation of Crimean Tatars was a state-organized and forcible eviction of Crimean Tatars people that was ordered by Joseph Stalin as a form of collective punishment in 1944. It was supposed to completely remove the Crimean Tatar nationality from the demographic map of the world. It ruined the traditional way of life, social structure, and cultural institutes of Crimean Tatars. Indeed, Crimean Tatars were supposed to assimilate in exile. As a result of state-sponsored violence, Crimean Tatars became a nation in exile. After Stalin&#x27;s death they did not receive the right to return to Crimea and renew their autonomy, like most &quot;punished peoples.&quot; However, Crimean Tatars escaped the fate and managed to reshape their identity. Moreover, despite the ban, Crimean Tatars tried to return to their homeland during the Soviet era.
In the presentation the question &quot;How did Crimean Tatars returnees dealt with &#x27;homecoming&#x27;?&quot; will be answered. Studying the Crimean Tatars&#x27; return contribute significantly not only to the history of Crimean Tatars, moreover, it is important for the understanding of reverse migration process in migration studies. The research, foremost, is based on oral history interviews. So the special attention will be paid to doing Oral History in Crimea.
 


 
A historian of Crimean Tatars, Martin-Oleksandr Kisly (History Department of National university of Kyiv-Mohyla academy) holds a Candidate of Science degree, having defended a dissertation entitled &quot;Crimean Tatars’ Return to the Homeland in 1956–1989&quot;. His research focuses on memory, trauma, identity and migration. Fulbright Research and Development program fellow (2017, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). IWM fellow (2022).

        <p>Abstract
How does public history intersect with citizen science on crowdsourcing platforms like Zooniverse? This talk will use examples drawn from the Living with Machines project, a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute and British Library with partner universities, to consider this question. Living with Machines is developing digital history and data science methods to explore vast digitised corpora of historical collections from the long 19th century. Crowdsourcing was built into the project from the very beginning, both as a form of public engagement and a method for data collection. Participants comments and survey results provide insights into their experiences reading and annotating historical newspaper articles.

Title: Determining Author or Reader: A Statistical Analysis of Textual Features in Children’s and Adult Literature
Abstract: Due to the nature of literary texts as being composed of words rather than numbers, they are not an obvious choice to serve as data for statistical analyses. However, with the help of computational techniques, words can be converted to numerical data and certain parts of a text can be examined on a large scale. Textual elements such as sentence length, word length and lexical diversity, which are associated by scholars on the one hand with the writing style of an individual author and on the other with the complexity of a text and the intended age of its readers, can thus be subjected to statistical evaluation. In this paper, data from little under 700 English and Dutch books written for different ages is analysed using a statistical linear mixed model. The results show that the textual elements studied are better qualified to detect the age of the intended reader of a text than the identity or age of the author.

Title:
Abstract: Good Omens  is a collaborative novel written by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Rising interest in the book, amplified by the success of the recent screen adaptation, has aroused curiosity regarding its realization. We use Rolling Delta and Rolling Classify to detect stylistic signals from each author as these methods reveal authorial takeovers. The same techniques are applied to compare the screenplay of the show to the novel. The results indicate that  Good Omens  resembles Pratchett’s work more closely. The screenplay is correctly attributed to Gaiman, its sole author, and the comparison reveals that Gaiman may have relied less on the source material over the course of the narrative arc.

Title:
Abstract: We apply Top2Vec to a corpus of 10,921 novels in the Dutch language. For the  purposes of our research we want to understand if our topic model may serve as a proxy for genre. We find that topics are extremely narrowly related to an existing genre classification historically created by publishers. Interestingly we also find that, notwithstanding careful vocabulary filtering as suggested by prior research, various other signals, such as author signal, stubbornly remain.

Title: Boosting Word Frequencies in Authorship Attribution
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce a simple method of computing relative word frequencies for authorship attribution and similar stylometric tasks. Rather than computing relative frequencies as the number of occurrences of a given word divided by the total number of tokens in a text, I argue that a more efficient normalization factor is the total number of  relevant  tokens only. The notion of relevant words includes synonyms and, usually, a few dozen other words in some ways semantically similar to a word in question. To determine such a semantic background, one of word embedding models can be used. The proposed method outperforms classical most-frequent-word approaches substantially, usually by a few percentage points depending on the input settings.

Title: Peeking Inside the DH Toolbox – Detection and Classification of Software Tools in DH Publications
Abstract: Digital tools have played an important role in Digital Humanities (DH) since its beginnings. Accordingly, a lot of research has been dedicated to the documentation of tools as well as to the analysis of their impact from an epistemological perspective. In this paper we propose a binary and a multi-class classification approach to detect and classify tools. The approach builds on state-of-the-art neural language models. We test our model on two different corpora and report the results for different parameter configurations in two consecutive experiments. In the end, we demonstrate how the models can be used for actual tool detection and tool classification tasks in a large corpus of DH journals.

Title: Modeling Plots of Narrative Texts as Temporal Graphs
Abstract: The paper outlines a formal model of plot (and syuzhet) for narrative texts. The basic   unit are scenes and the motif repertoire instantiated in the scene. The motif repertoire   consists of three sets of (closely related) elements: character stereotypes, types of   verbal actions and action types. It is assumed that the motif repertoire is highly   dependent on the corpus which is analyzed, in our case a corpus of romance and horror   novels published as pulp fiction. The resulting information is represented in a temporal   graph which in turn is used to compute relevant information on the scenes and   characters. Scenes are also characterized by their valence and their arousal value. A second representation which offers with a topic model of the direct speech and the  narrative text a simple proxy for the types of verbal actions and the action types is also created. To assess the ability of these information structures to indicate changes   in the temporal structures three evaluation methods are used based on artificial data.   We can confirm that a very abstract representation of the plot is able to do so, but   contrary to our expectations the more information-rich model which makes use of the   topic model is not better in doing so. The main contribution of this paper is its   attempt to integrate different research proposals into one integral model. We offer a   descriptive framework and a proposal for the formal model of plot, which makes it   possible to identify research problems and align existing approaches.

Title: A Quantitative Study of Fictional Things
Abstract: In this paper, we apply machine learning based predictive models on two large data sets of historical and contemporary fiction to better understand the role that things play in fictional writing. A large body of scholarship known as &#x60;&#x60;thing theory’’ has attempted to understand the function of fictional things within literature mostly by focusing on small case studies. We provide the first-ever estimates of the distribution of different types of things in English-language fiction over the past two centuries along with experiments to model their semantic identity. Our findings suggest that the most common fictional things are structural in nature, functioning akin to narrative props. We conclude by showing how these findings pose problems for inherited theories of fictional things and propose an alternative theoretical framework, embodied cognition, as a way of understanding the predominance of structural things.

Title: Reviewer Preferences and Gender Disparities in Aesthetic Judgments
Abstract: Aesthetic preferences are considered highly subjective resulting in inherently noisy judgments of aesthetic objects, yet certain aspects of aesthetic judgment display convergent trends over time. This paper presents a study that uses literary reviews as a proxy for aesthetic judgment in order to identify systematic components that can be attributed to bias. Specifically, we find that judgments of literary quality differ across media types and display a gender bias. In newspapers, male reviewers have a same-gender preference while female reviewers show an opposite–gender preference. On the other hand, in the blogosphere female reviewers prefer female authors. While alternative accounts exist of this apparent gender disparity, we argue that it reflects a cultural gender antagonism that is necessary to take into account when doing computational assessment of aesthetics.

Title: Gender and Power in Japanese Light Novels
Abstract: In Japanese culture, the light novel – a combination of text and anime-style illustrations–is a relatively new literary form. It derives from the broader otaku culture, which is also associated with video games, manga, cosplay, anime, and other forms of Japanese popular culture. Though the light novel lacks the global reach of some of these other genres, such as manga and anime, it nonetheless attracts millions of readers across a range of gender and age groups. While distinct subgenres of the light novel have emerged, such as romance, adventure, horror, and harem, issues of gender stereotyping, power imbalances and other forms of inequality remain strongly entrenched. These issues can be attributed to how otaku culture is rooted in heterosexual male desire. This paper offers a quantitative assessment of these issues of gender inequality. We analyze 290 light novels, scraped from the Baka-Tsuki Translation Community Wiki, in terms of the power relationships between female and male characters as they evolve over the course of each novel. We find patterns consistent with issues of gender stereotyping and power differentials. More specifically, we find that female characters consistently wield less power than male characters, especially toward the end of each novel. We find some variation in specific subgenres. We conclude with close readings of two light novels, demonstrating how a power frames approach to analyzing gender stereotypes in otaku culture augments existing work on the subject.

Title: Detecting Sequential Genre Change in Eighteenth-Century Texts
Abstract: Machine classification of historical books into genres is a common task for NLP-based classifiers and has a number of applications, from literary analysis to information retrieval. However it is not a straightforward task, as genre labels can be ambiguous and subject to temporal change, and moreoever many books consist of mixed or miscellaneous genres. In this paper we describe a work-in-progress method by which genre predictions can be used to determine longer sequences of genre change within books, which we test out with visualisations of some hand-picked texts. We apply state-of-the-art methods to the task, including a BERT-based transformer and character-level Perceiver model, both pre-trained on a large collection of eighteenth century works (ECCO), using a new set of hand-annotated documents created to reflect historical divisions. Results show that both models perform significantly better than a linear baseline, particularly when ECCO-BERT is combined with tfidf features, though for this task the character-level model provides no obvious advantage. Initial evaluation of the genre sequence method shows it may in the future be useful in determining and dividing the multiple genres of miscellaneous and hybrid historical texts.

Title: Measuring Rhythm Regularity in Verse: Entropy of Inter-Stress Intervals
Abstract: Recognition of poetic meters is not a trivial task, since metrical labels are not a closed set of classes. Outside of classical meters, describing the metrical structure of a poem in a large corpus requires expertise and a shared scientific theory. In a situation when both components are lacking, alternative and continuous measures of regularity can be envisioned. This paper focuses on poetic rhythm to propose a simple entropy-based measure for poem regularity using counts of non-stressed intervals. The measure is validated using subsets of a well-annotated Russian poetic corpus, prose, and quasi-poems (prose chopped into lines). The regularity measure is able to detect a clear difference between various organizational principles of texts: average entropy rises when moving from accentual-syllabic meters to accentual variations to free verse and prose. Interval probabilities, when taken as a vector of features, also allow for classification at the level of individual poems. This paper argues that distinguishing between meter as a cultural idea and rhythm as an empirical sequence of sounds can lead to better understanding of form recognition and prosodic annotation problems.

Title: Chronicling Crises: Event Detection in Early Modern Chronicles from the Low Countries
Abstract: Between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth century, many middle-class Europeans kept a handwritten chronicle, in which they reported on events they considered relevant. Discussed topics varied from records of price fluctuations to local politics, and from weather reports to remarkable gossip. What we do not know yet, is to what extent times of conflict and crises influenced the way in which people dealt with information. We have applied methods from information theory – dynamics in word usage and measures of relative entropy such as  novelty  and  resonance  – to a corpus of early modern chronicles from the Low Countries (1500–1820) to provide more insight in the way early modern people were coping with information during impactful events. We detect three peaks in the novelty signal, which coincide with times of political uncertainty in the Northern and Southern Netherlands. Topic distributions provided by Top2Vec show that during these times, chroniclers tend to write more and more extensively about an increased variation of topics.

Title: What Shall We Do With the Unseen Sailor? Estimating the Size of the Dutch East India Company Using an Unseen Species Model
Abstract: Historians base their inquiries on the sources that are available to them. However, not all sources that are relevant to the historian’s inquiry may have survived the test of time. Consequently, the resulting data can be biased in unknown ways, possibly skewing analyses. This paper deals with the Dutch East India Company its digitized ledgers of contracts. We apply an unseen species model, a method from ecology, to estimate the  actual  number of unique seafarers contracted. We find that the lower bound of actual seafarers is much higher than what the remaining contracts indicate: at least, thirty-six percent of the seafarers is unknown. Moreover, we find that even in periods when few records survived, we can still credibly estimate a lower bound on the unique number of seafarers.

Title: Lost Manuscripts and Extinct Texts: A Dynamic Model of Cultural Transmission
Abstract: How did written works evolve, disappear or survive down through the ages? In this paper, we propose a unified, formal framework for two fundamental questions in the study of the transmission of texts: how much was lost or preserved from all works of the past, and why do their genealogies (their &quot;phylogenetic trees’‘) present the very peculiar shapes that we observe or, more precisely, reconstruct? We argue here that these questions share similarities to those encountered in evolutionary biology, and can be described in terms of &quot;genetic’’ drift and &quot;natural’’ selection.  Through agent-based models, we show that such properties as have been observed by philologists since the 1800s can be simulated, and confronted to data gathered for ancient and medieval texts across Europe, in order to obtain plausible estimations of the number of works and manuscripts that existed and were lost.

Title: Differentiating Social Media Texts via Clustering
Abstract: We propose to use clustering of documents based on their fine-grained linguistic properties in order to capture and validate text type distinctions such as medium and register. Correlating the bottom-up, linguistic feature driven clustering with text type distinctions (medium and register) enables us to quantify the influence of individual author choice and medium/register conventions on variable linguistic phenomena. Our pilot study applies the method to German particles and intensifiers in a multimedia corpus, annotated for register. We show that German particles and intensifiers differ across both register and medium. The clustering based on the linguistic features most closely corresponds to the medium distinction, while the stratification into registers is reflected to a lesser extent.

Title: Emodynamics: Detecting and Characterizing Pandemic Sentiment Change Points on Danish Twitter
Abstract: In this paper, we present the results of an initial experiment using emotion classifications as the basis for studying information dynamics in social media (&#x60;emodynamics’). To do this, we used Bert Emotion to assign probability scores for eight different emotions to each text in a time series of 43 million Danish tweets from 2019-2022. We find that variance in the information signals novelty and resonance reliably identify seasonal shifts in posting behavior, particularly around the Christmas holiday season, whereas variance in  the distribution of emotion scores corresponds to more local events such as major inflection points in the Covid-19 pandemic in Denmark. This work in progress suggests that emotion scores are a useful tool for diagnosing shifts in the baseline information state of social media platforms such as Twitter, and for understanding how social media systems respond to both predictable and unexpected external events.

Title: Detecting Formulaic Language Use in Historical Administrative Corpora
Abstract: Historical administrative corpora are filled with jargon and formulaic expressions that were used consistently across many documents. Governmental decisions, notarial deeds and official charters often contain fixed expressions to ensure that the same legal aspects in different documents had the same interpretation.  Such formulaic expressions can be used to identify specific elements of a document. For instance, a deed has different formulas to indicate whether it concerns the sale of property or the transferal of rights.  In this paper we explore formulas as a methodological devise to structure the text of an administrative corpus and make the information contained in it better accessible. We use a data-driven method to detect potential formulaic expressions in historical corpora, that can deal with spelling variation and change and recognition errors introduced in the digitisation process. We apply this exploratory technique on a corpus of almost 300,000 eighteenth-century resolutions of the States General of the Dutch Republic and find many formulaic expressions that capture relationships between the political actors involved and the decisions that were made. A first analysis suggests that many formulas can be used to add metadata to individual resolutions on various elements of the proposals and decisions that are part of each resolution.

Title: Introducing Functional Diversity: A Novel Approach to Lexical Diversity in (Historical) Corpora
Abstract: The question how we can reliably estimate the lexical diversity of a particular text (collection) has often been asked by linguists and literary scholars alike. This short paper introduces a way of operationalizing functional diversity measurements by means of token-based embeddings, and argues that functional diversity is not only a practically advantageous, but also a theoretically relevant addition to the Computational Humanities Research toolkit. By means of an experiment on the historical ARCHER corpus, we show that lexical diversity at the level of functional groups is less sensitive to orthographic variation, and provides insight into an important and often disregarded dimension of vocabulary diversity in textual data.

Title: Linguistic Value Construction in 18th-Century London Auction Advertisements: a Quantitative Approach
Abstract: Georgian England was characterised by a buzzing consumer society in which advertising played a progressively important role when it came to the (linguistic) value construction surrounding material goods. Increasingly, the perceived value of goods was not only determined by the intrinsic quality of the goods, but also by the socio-commercial discourse used to characterise them. Linguistic modifiers, such as adjectives, must have played an important role in this process – reflecting these socio-economical trends in text while also reinforcing them. Here, we focus on a diachronic corpus of over 5,000 pages of London auction advertisement pages, digitised via automated transcription and divided across four sample periods between 1742-1829. Prime methodological challenges include: (1) the noisiness of the available data because of imperfect transcription; (2) the coarseness of the available time stamps, and (3) the lack of suitable NLP software, such as lemmatizers or (shallow) syntactic parsers. Through the use of word embeddings, we try to alleviate the issue of spelling variation with reasonable success. We find that, over time, subjective or ‘evaluative’ modifiers have become more prominent in these advertisements than their objective or ‘descriptive’ counterparts – but there are different temporal patterns for different types of advertised objects

Title: The Roots of Doubt. Fine-tuning a BERT Model to Explore a Stylistic Phenomenon
Abstract: The narrative work of well-known Italian author Italo Calvino (1923-1985) features a phenomenon that literary critics refer to as &#x60;&#x60;dubitative text’&#x27;: this stylistic device consciously hinders the narrative progression of a story, by questioning its own content. We report on an attempt to model the presence of dubitative text in Calvino’s fictional oeuvre and examine whether this model can also be used to retrieve dubitative instances in his essayistic oeuvre. We hypothesize that precisely the category of the dubitative text yields interesting points of intersection between both writing modes. We fine-tuned a BERT model based on a manually annotated dataset and report inter-annotator scores. We situate our findings and model criticism in the current landscape of Calvino scholarship. While detecting dubitative text is challenging, our model provides fresh insights into the device’s surface features.

Title: The Process of Imitatio Through Stylometric Analysis: the Case of Terence’s Eunuchus
Abstract: The Early Modern Era is at the forefront of a widespread enthusiasm for Latin works: texts from classical antiquity are given new life, widely re-printed, studied and even repeatedly staged, in the case of dramas, throughout Europe. Also, new Latin comedies are again written in quantities never seen before (at least 10,000 works published 1500 to 1800 are known). The authors themselves, within the game of literary imitation (the process of  imitatio), start to mimic the style of ancient authors, and Terence’s dramas in particular were considered the prime sources of reuse for many decades.   Via a case study “the reception of Terence’s  Eunuchus  in Early Modern literature”, we take a deep dive into the mechanisms of literary imitation. Our analysis is based on four comedy corpora in Latin, Italian, French and English, spanning roughly 3 centuries (1400-1700). To assess the problem of language shift and multi-language inter-corpora analysis, we base our experiments on translations of the  Eunuchus , one for each sub-corpus. Through the use of tools drawn from the field of Stylometry, we address the topic of text reuse and textual similarities between Terence’s text and Early-Modern corpora to get a better grasp on the internal fluctuations of the imitation game between Early Modern and Classical authors.

Title: One Graph to Rule them All: Using NLP and Graph Neural Networks to analyse Tolkien’s Legendarium
Abstract: Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning have considerably advanced Computational Literary Studies. Similarly, the construction of co-occurrence networks of literary characters, and their analysis using methods from social network analysis and network science, have provided insights into the micro- and macro-level structure of literary texts. Combining these perspectives, in this work we study character networks extracted from a text corpus of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Legendarium. We show that this perspective helps us to analyse and visualise the narrative style that characterises Tolkien’s works. Addressing character classification, embedding and co-occurrence prediction, we further investigate the advantages of state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks over a popular word embedding method. Our results highlight the large potential of graph learning in Computational Literary Studies.

Title: Correlations between GoodReads Appreciation and the Sentiment Arc Fractality of the Grimm brothers’ Fairy Tales
Abstract: Despite their widespread popularity, fairy tales are often overlooked when studying literary quality with quantitative approaches. We present a study on the relation between sentiment fractality and literary appreciation by testing the hypothesis that fairy tales with a good balance between unpredictability and excessive self-similarity in their sentiment narrative arcs tend to be more popular and more appreciated by audiences of readers. In short, we perform a correlation study of the degree of fractality of the fairy tales of the Grimm brothers and their current appreciation as measured by their Goodreads scores. Moreover, we look at the popularity of these fairy tales through time, determining which ones have come to form a strong “internal canon” in the corpus of the authors and which one have fallen into relative obscurity.

Title: &#x60;Entrez!’ she called: Evaluating Language Identification Tools in English Literary Texts
Abstract: This short paper presents work in progress on the evaluation of current language identification (LI) tools for identifying foreign language n-grams in English-language literary texts, for instance, “‘Entrez!’ she called”. We first manually annotated French and Spanish words appearing in 12,000-word text samples by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway using a TEI tag. We then split the tagged sample texts into four groups of n-grams, from unigram to tetragram, and compared the accuracy of five LI packages on correctly identifying the language of the tagged foreign-language snippets. We report that, of the packages tested, Fasttext proved most accurate for this task overall, but that methodological questions and future work remain.

Title: Automatic Identification and Classification of Portraits in a Corpus of Historical Photographs
Abstract: There have been recent calls for an increased focus on the application of computer vision to the study and curation of digitised cultural heritage materials. In this short paper, we present an approach to bridge the gap between existing algorithms and humanistically driven annotations through a case study in which we create an algorithm to detect and and classify portrait photography. We apply this method to a collection of about 40,000 photographs and present a preliminary analysis of the constructed data. The work  is part of the larger ongoing study that applies computer vision to the computational analysis of over a million U.S. documentary photographs from the early twentieth century.

Title: Page Layout Analysis of Text-heavy Historical Documents: a Comparison of Textual and Visual Approaches
Abstract: Page layout analysis is a fundamental step in document processing which enables to segment a page into regions of interest. With highly complex layouts and mixed scripts, scholarly commentaries are text-heavy documents which remain challenging for state-of-the-art models. Their layout considerably varies across editions and their most important regions are mainly defined by semantic rather than graphical characteristics such as position or appearance. This setting calls for a comparison between textual, visual and hybrid approaches. We therefore assess the performances of two transformers (LayoutLMv3 and RoBERTa) and an objection-detection network (YOLOv5). If results show a clear advantage in favor of the latter, we also list several caveats to this finding. In addition to our experiments, we release a dataset of ca. 300 annotated pages sampled from 19th  century commentaries.

Title: The Computational Memorability of Iconic Images
Abstract: The perception of historic events is frequently shaped by specific images that  have been ascribed an iconic status. These images are widely reproduced and recognised and can therefore be considered memorable. A question that arises given such images is whether the memorability of iconic images is intrinsic or whether it is shaped. In this work we analyse the memorability of iconic images by means of computational  techniques that are specifically designed to measure the intrinsic memorability of images. To judge whether iconic images are inherently more memorable we establish two baselines based on datasets of diverse imagery and of newspaper imagery. Our findings show that iconic images are not more memorable than modern day newspaper imagery or when compared to a diverse set of everyday images. In fact, by and large many of the iconic images analysed score on the low end of the memorability spectrum. Additionally, we explore the variation in memorability of reproductions of iconic images  and find that certain images have been edited resulting in higher memorability scores,  but that the images by and large are reproduced with memorability close to the original.

Title: Ground-truth Free Evaluation of HTR on Old French and Latin Medieval Literary Manuscripts
Abstract: As more and more projects openly release ground truth for handwritten text recognition (HTR), we expect the quality of automatic transcription to improve on unseen data. Getting models robust to scribal and material changes is a necessary step for specific data mining tasks. However, evaluation of HTR results requires ground truth to compare prediction statistically. In the context of modern languages, successful attempts to evaluate quality have been done using lexical features or n-grams. This, however, proves difficult in the context of spelling variation that both Old French and Latin have, even more so in the context of sometime heavily abbreviated manuscripts. We propose a new method based on deep learning where we attempt to categorize each line error rate into four error rate ranges ( 0 &lt; 10 %  &lt; 25  %  &lt; 50 %  &lt; 100 % ) using three different encoder (GRU with Attention, BiLSTM, TextCNN). To train these models, we propose a new dataset engineering approach using early stopped model, as an alternative to rule-based fake predictions. Our model largely outperforms the n-gram approach. We also provide an example application to qualitatively analyse our classifier, using classification on new prediction on a sample of 1,800 manuscripts ranging from the 9th century to the 15th.

Multimodal digital scholarly publications offer unique affordances over traditional print publishing formats by enabling authors to integrate innovative digital tools and/or data, as well as media-rich enhancements in their scholarly publications. Recent publications taking advantage of such digital affordances have included monographs, enhanced journals, hybrid digital &amp; print projects, as well as podcasts. How are these projects designed and developed to be sustainable, discoverable, and accessible in the long term? Who is publishing them? And how can graduate students and early career scholars acquire the skills and/or find support to develop digital publications? 
This presentation will address how academic publishers are approaching multimodal born-digital and hybrid publications, as well as how libraries are supporting contemporary digital publishing methods. In particular it will introduce the range of recent scholarly digital publications and the University Presses actively seeking proposals. It will also touch on considerations for developing a digital publication, including the DH skill set learning curve, pitching a project to an editor, writing for a public audience, platforms, preservation, and accessibility, and resources for getting started.

        <p>According to the Unesco, “digital heritage consists of unique resources of human knowledge and expression. It embraces cultural, educational, scientific and administrative resources, as well as technical, legal, medical and other  kinds  of  information  created  digitally,  or  converted  into  digital  form  from  existing  analogue  resources. Where resources are “born digital”, there is no other format but the digital object. Digital  materials  include  texts,  databases,  still  and  moving  images,  audio,  graphics,  software  and  web  pages,  among  a  wide  and  growing  range  of  formats.  They  are  frequently  ephemeral,  and  require purposeful production, maintenance, and management to be retained ”.

        <p>Different publics do not simply consume history in museums (as visitors or users) but may also contribute to preserving, producing, and exhibiting history. The symposium will explore questions such as what groups and communities can bring to the production of history in museums and their impact on historical narratives and on the institutions representing them. It will also delve into the limits and challenges of participatory practices and co-production processes in history museums.
What can public participants (not) do? What skills and knowledge are necessary? What are the examples of collaborative decision-making processes that allow contributions from the different publics and how do they affect the role and functioning of museums?

Or, paraphrasing Samuel Beckett, hopefully you have failed better. Over the last decade, game designers John Sharp and Colleen Macklin have interviewed creative practitioners—from chefs to skateboarders, filmmakers to winemakers, and toy designers to comedians to see how they manage the inevitable failures encountered in their practices. Join Sharp and Macklin as they share some of the lessons they’ve learned from game design and other creative disciplines. Because while everyone fails, some do it better. Because without f…</p>

Indem die Autoren und Autorinnen fiktive, „auf wahren Begebenheiten beruhende“ oder reale Geschichten erzählen, die Geschichten der Helden von „This Hard Minett Land“, „struggling to do everything right“ („Brilliant Disguise“). Begleitet werden die Texte in deutscher, englischer, französischer und luxemburgischer Sprache von Illustrationen des Luxemburger Künstlers Dan Altmann.
Die offizielle Buchpräsentation findet statt am
Dienstag, 15. November 2022 ab 19.00 Uhr
im „Pompelhaus“ in Schifflingen (ehemaliges Gelände der Metzeschmelz), Eingang an der Kreuzung Rue de Lallange/Rue du Moulin
mit musikalischer Einlage von Claudine Muno, die einige Springsteen-Songs singen wird, sowie vom Jazz-Musiker Luciano Pagliarini, die beide auch zu den AutorInnen gehören. Anschließend lädt die Gemeinde Schifflingen zu einem Umtrunk ein.
Um Antwort (im Fall der Teilnahme, ob allein oder in Begleitung) wird gebeten per E-Mail an denis.scuto@uni.lu oder jaspers@capybarabooks.com bis zum 9. November 2022.

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>Mixed Reality, in its many forms, is generally characterised by its audiovisual, spatial and immersive nature, blending virtual content with elements of physical reality into an arrangement that allows users to physically walk through and interact with the resulting three-dimensional hybrid space. Due to these qualities cultural institutions worldwide are experimenting with new ways of communicating, reviving and preserving cultural heritage. The session will show how adapting a body-based design approach that goes beyond the audiovisual can bring about new forms of learning and understanding history.
Katharina Tillmanns is a researcher, designer and lecturer for interactive immersive media at TH Köln (https://colognegamelab.de). A former co-president of the Games for Change Europe network and director of the Notgames Fest, she has been exploring and promoting the expressive qualities of games and other playful media as a means of art and activism for the past 12+ years. Currently Katharina is focusing on her dissertation research, which examines multi-sensory learning in the context of mixed reality environments.

        <p>Un petit pays comme le Luxembourg qui veut développer une recherche de pointe à rayonnement international se voulant en même temps au service du pays se trouve confronté à un problème difficile en ce qui concerne son modèle de gouvernance: d’un côté les moyens forcément limités si on les regarde à l’échelle internationale investis en recherche obligent à faire des choix et à définir des priorités ; d’un autre côté on sait que les percées scientifiques se laissent très difficilement prédire et se font dans des environnements qui laissent une place importante à la prise de risques et aux idées dont l’impact est initialement très incertain. Une discussion sera faite dans quelle mesure la stratégie nationale de la recherche et de l’innovation essaye de trouver des réponses à ce champ de tension.

        <p>Germany’s “Century of Sex” (D. Herzog) offers a case in point for studying gender ambivalences in (post)war contexts. Though gender and sexuality are “useful categories of historical analysis” (Joan W. Scott), they remain profoundly recalcitrant, as they combine liberalisation and repression, consent and violence, the private and the public… As I shall argue, masculinities offer insightful perspectives for understanding German society and Europe at war. Nazism, which advocated an ideal of comradeship and racial purity, regulated gender, sexualities and procreation through racist, homophobic, sexist and eugenic laws. Yet the period also saw the coexistence of sexual constraints and forms of gender violence with the opening of new spaces for sexual and gender experimentation. The Nazi war of…</p>

Text and corpus analysis lie at the heart of digital scholarship in the humanities and social sciences, and a wide range of software tools are available in this domain. These software tools represent prime examples of the ways in which language technologies can support research across a range of disciplines, and they are therefore central to CLARIN’s mission. CLARIN is gathering information and publishing a Resource Family to provide users, both expert and novice, with a free online guide to the discovery and use of these vital tools. The CLARIN Café in September 2022 presented some of the key applications currently in use among research communities, and invited feedback on the Resource Fam…</p>

        <p>Taking the post-conflict context of Northern Ireland as a case study, this lecture will explore some of the challenges of engaging in Public History in a region where the prevailing historical narratives are contested at the most basic level. It will ask to what extent the public use of history plays a part in reinforcing divisions and continuing senses of ‘otherness’. However, it will also look at the important role public history can play in such contexts either as a form of conflict transformation, disrupting dominant narratives and opening up space for dialogue, or as a means of promoting wellbeing and increased senses of belonging among divided and often disadvantaged urban communities.

        <p>Join archivist Lynsey Gillespie (PRONI), access and outreach Officer Bronagh McAtasney (Northern Ireland Screen), and creative producer Laura Aguiar (Nerve Centre) to hear how their organisations have developed forms of creative engagement that puts the public at the heart of archives and helps to democratise access to public history in Northern Ireland. In this public lecture, they will discuss the role of sharing authority in their work and how this has been applied from collecting to cataloguing and public engagement. Drawing on a selection of sample projects, they will demonstrate how they have used participatory methods to help PRONI and Northern Ireland Screen fill gaps within their collections and be more reflective and relevant to a diverse society.

330 Fisher-Bennett Hall 



This talk will read Ben Stiller’s Severance (2021-), and Apple TV+ programming generally in light of Apple’s unique position in the streaming ecosystem. A service provider as well as a device maker, Apple brands its media productions as exactingly as it does its phones, tablets, computers, and watches. As a result, its content is branded in ways that Netflix and HBO Max’s, for example, is not; indeed, Apple’s still relatively small stable of film and TV content expresses the firm’s manufacturing interests in ways that even Sony’s content, say, does not. This talk establishes the coherence of Apple’s TV branding and asks how it should matter to a materialist critical practice. Specifically, it asks if the very coherence of Apple’s trans-corporate branding makes it possible to glimpse in Apple content the otherwise hidden, outsourced, upstream production processes upon which the company still depends.
Michael Szalay is Professor of English at the University of California, Irvine. He teaches 20th- and 21st-century fiction, television, and film, as well as courses on World-Systems Theory and the origins of capitalism. His first two books (Hip Figures: A Literary History of the Democratic Party and New Deal Modernism: American Literature and the Invention of the Welfare State) examine the relationship between literature, liberal governance, and economic crisis. His forthcoming book, Second Lives: Black-Market Melodramas and the Reinvention of Television (Chicago, 2023), defines a new television genre—the black-market melodrama—that has driven the ascent of TV as a cultural force over the last two decades, and that continues to mediate the ongoing effects of deindustrialization on a changing U.S. middle class.

        <p>Insurgent Academics, my new book project, constructs an intellectual history of what I term “academic insurgency,” which links contemporary developments in mobilized, experimental, digital, and public humanities emerging in African diaspora, U.S. ethnic, and postcolonial studies to a longer trajectory of interventions made by scholars of colour within higher education. These “insurgent academics,” I argue,</p>

        <p>Tourné en Lorraine et au Luxembourg, « L‘usine secrète » propose un regard empathique et fort sur la sidérurgie et les mines, en montrant des dessous peu connus de ce monde particulier : l’autonomie, l’humour, la débrouille, la fauche, la bricole, l’alcool, l’entraide. Comment tissait-on des liens entre sidérurgistes ou mineurs ? Comment déjouait-on les surveillances des gardes pour sortir du materiel ? Comment s’arrangeait-on pour « bricoler » sur place des objets qu’on ramenait ensuite à la maison ou dans son jardin ? Comment prenait-on des libertés sur les règlements ? Et qu’est devenue avec le temps cette autonomie ouvrière connue mais peu racontée ? Au final, à quoi servaient ces systèmes de transgression ?
« L’usine secrète » dresse un portrait original et inhabituel du monde ouvrier et de ses évolutions sur 50 ans. Il fait partie de ces rares documentaires sur des sujets sérieux mais traités avec humour et donc pouvant aussi s’adresser « aux jeunes »… Car l’autonomie dans le travail est un thème universel.

        <p>Border studies is an interdisciplinary field of research in which existing scholarship has primarily been spatially oriented. The conference Borders In Flux and Border Temporalities In and Beyond Europe sheds light on research that focuses on the temporality of borders. The conference connects leading researchers as well as established and early-stage researchers to present, share and discuss their research on borders, borderlands, and border regions in and beyond 19th and 20th century Europe.
The conference invites scholars whose research sheds light on the temporal dimension of borders by exploring border practices, border discourses, and analyses of border regimes and life at the border in Europe.

        <p>This dataset includes derived data on a collection of ca. 2,700 books in English published between 2001–2021 and spanning 12 different genres. The data was manually collected to capture popular writing aimed at a range of different readerships across fiction (1,934) and non-fiction (820). Genres include forms of cultural capital (bestsellers, prizewinners, elite book reviews), stylistic affinity (mysteries, science fiction, biography, etc.), and age-level (middle-grade and young adult). The dataset allows researchers to explore the effects of audience, genre, and instrumentality (i.e., fictionality) on the stylistic behavior of authors within the recent past across different classes of professionally published writing.

Publication of Cather’s correspondence nearly complete 



The digitization, transcription and annotation of all of Willa Cather’s known letters is nearly finished. More than 2,600 of the 3,200 pieces of correspondence have been published online through the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Willa Cather Archive.
The feat has spanned nearly a decade, with the first letters published in book form, “The Selected Letters of Willa Cather,” in 2013, after the moratorium on their publication was lifted in 2011. The digital humanities project “The Complete Letters of Willa Cather” followed close behind.
Andrew Jewell, project director and co-editor for “The Complete Letters of Willa Cather,” said the remaining letters are in the pipeline for publication and he expects the work t…</p>

        <p>Rapid-response digital archives have emerged as a standard way digital humanities teams document community in time of crisis. Their strength lies in building connections to communities and collecting materials that will be critical to future generations of scholars. In documenting the pandemic (2020-22) A Journal of a Plague Year: An Archive of Covid-19 challenged the traditional approach to curating rapid-response archives seeking by assigning robust metadata to objects as they entered the archive. This archival metadata included curatorial tags, contributor tags, and in some cases community-assigned tags. This talk discusses that effort, including the strengths and limitations of crowd-based curation; it will include a meditation on how such efforts at crowd curation might enhance the accessibility of rapid response archives, especially archives of the pandemic

        <p>In this paper we present the first-ever procedure for identifying highly similar sequences of text in Chinese and Tibetan translations of Buddhist sūtra literature. We initially propose this procedure as an aid to scholars engaged in the philological study of Buddhist documents. We create a cross-lingual embedding space by taking the cosine similarity of average sequence vectors in order to produce unsupervised similar cross-linguistic parallel alignments at word, sentence, and even paragraph level. Initial results show that our method lays a solid foundation for the future development of a fully-fledged Information Retrieval tool for these (and potentially other) low-resource historical languages.

        <p>New Impact Story: Re-evaluating Child Language Assessment Measures for Research and Clinical Use

            

  
  
            
    

              
              
                  

  
Dr Nan Bernstein Ratner talks about her latest project CLASP (Child Language ASessment Project), which makes use of datasets at the CLARIN Knowledge Centre TalkBank. The project hopes to provide a stronger evidence base for child language assessment, which will improve future research, as well as support clinicians in mapping out the most effective treatments for children with language disorders.
Bernstein Ratner also discusses how spoken language data is increasingly being used by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) industry in order to train voice assistants to recognise speech by people who stutter.

        <p>Scholars from across disciplinary boundaries have attempted to crack the code of videogame history and preservation for the last decade. Yet, much of what is published on these topics is still dominated by journalistic accounts. As such, game scholars and historians should build bridges and collaborate. This presentation will give an overview of videogame history and preservation, the field game studies, and an oral history methodology tailored specifically to videogames. 
The following day, our guest speaker will conduct a workshop to provide a hands-on demonstration of the research methodology illustrated by his talk.

        <p>The presentation shows the results of Anna Bączkowska&#x27;s research conducted at the University in Luxembourg over the last three months. It focuses on the analysis of immigration discourse retrieved from social media created by Polish immigrants to Luxembourg. The analysis is based on the polska.lu forum which spans the last 15 years. The data were extracted both manually and automatically; thus, three subcorpora were created. The language used by forum interactants was investigated with the aid of corpus linguistics tools in order to notice some trends and tendencies in lexical choices of the forum users as well as the prevailing topics.

        <p>Project Start Date: 

September, 2020



This project investigates the role of translation in nineteenth-century Russian literature’s rise to prominence in world literature as a case study in the processes whereby a nationally or linguistically defined literature may achieve circulation and recognition on a global level. We seek to understand the ways in which the canon of Russian literature was conceptualized and composed differently in different translated contexts; to query Pascale Casanova’s claim that Paris was the most important “capital” of the “World Republic of Letters”; and to determine which other locales played a significant role in the process of a “peripheral” literature’s incorporation into “world literature” in the space of less than a century.
19C RLT currently tracks book publications of works by Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky into English, French, and German from the death of Pushkin in 1837 to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, comprising a growing database as well as maps, graphs, and other visualizations of the data. Future phases are planned to add more authors and expand the scope to include other global contexts in which Russian literature became an important translated literature in the twentieth century and beyond.

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>The Trove Newspaper Harvester has been around in different forms for more than a decade. It helps you download all the articles in a Trove newspaper search, opening up new possibilities for large-scale analysis. You can use it as a command-line tool by installing a Python package, or through the Trove Newspaper Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench.
I’ve just overhauled development of the Python package. The new trove-newspaper-harvester replaces the old troveharvester repository. The command-line interface remains the same (with a few new options), so it’s really a drop in replacement. Read the full documentation of the new package for more details.

Here’s a summary of the changes:
the package can now be used as a library (that you incorporate into your own code) as well as a standalone command-line tool – this means you can embed the harvester in your own tools or workflows
both the library and the CLI now let you set the names of the directories in which your harvests will be saved – this makes it easier to organise your harvests into groups and give them meaningful names
the harvesting process now saves results into a newline-delimited JSON file (one JSON object per line) – the library has a save_csv() option to convert this to a CSV file, while the CLI automatically converts the results to CSV to maintain compatibility with previous versions
behind the scenes, the package is now developed and maintained using nbdev – this means the code and documentation are all generated from a set of Jupyter notebooks
the Jupyter notebooks include a variety of automatic tests which should make maintenance and development much easier in the future
I’ve also updated the Trove Newspaper Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench to use the new package. The new core library will make it easier to develop more complex harvesting examples – for example, searching for articles from a specific day across a range of years. If you find any problems, or want to suggest improvements, please raise an issue.</p>

        <p>In this post, we reach back in time to showcase an older project and highlight its impact on data visualization in Digital Humanities as well as its good practices to make different layers of scholarship available for increased transparency and reusability.  

Developed at Stanford with other research partners (&#x27;Cultures of Knowledge&#x27; at Oxford, the Groupe d&#x27;Alembert at CNRS, the KKCC-Circulation of Knowledge and Learned Practices in the 17th-century Dutch Republic, the DensityDesign ResearchLab), the &#x27;Mapping of the Republic of Letters Project&#x27; aimed at digitizing and visualizing the intellectual community throughout the XVI and XVIII centuries known as &#x27;Republic of Letters&#x27; (an overview of the concept can be found in Bots and Waquet, 1997), to get a better sense of the shape, size and associated intellectual network, its inherent complexities and  boundaries.

Below  we highlight the different, interrelated
layers of making project outputs available and reusable on the long term (way before FAIR data became a widespread policy imperative!): methodological reflections, interactive visualizations, the associated data and its data model schema. All of these layers are published in a trusted repository and are interlinked with each other via their Persistent Identifiers.

        <p>A few weeks ago I created a new search interface to the NSW Post Office Directories from 1886 to 1908. Since then, I’ve used the same process on the Sydney Telephone Directories from 1926 to 1954. Both of these publications had been digitised by the State Library of NSW and made available through Trove. To build the new interfaces I downloaded the text from Trove, indexed it by line, and linked it back to the online page images.
But there are similar directories from other states that are not available through Trove. The Tasmanian Post Office Directory, for example, has been digitised between 1890 and 1948 and made available as 48 individual PDF files from Libraries Tasmania. While it’s great that they’ve been digitised, it’s not really possible to search them without downloading all the P…</p>

        <p>FHA Credit, Redlining, and Rental Housing in Metropolitan America


Project Start Date: 

September, 2022



“Mortgaging Out” is a digital history project that illuminates the  impact of Federal Housing Administration credit policies  on the availability of affordable rental housing during and immediately following World War II. Scholars have illuminated the impact of redlining on  mortgage lending, demonstrating how African American homebuyers, in particular, were often locked out of the midcentury housing boom. This project shifts the focus to FHA-insured apartment complexes. Drawing upon  a comprehensive data set FHA mortgage insurance data that catalogues more than 50,000 FHA-insured apartment buildings, the project maps the location, size (by unit count), and construction dates of roughly 7,000 projects constructed under the FHA wartime housing program (Section 608, 1942-1950). Future versions of the map may include FHA-backed market-rate multifamily housing (Section 207) as well as multifamily rental projects on urban renewal sites (Section 220) and for those displaced from urban renewal sites (Section 221).

        <p>In this presentation, Frédéric Calvert will talk about the COST action SlowMemo. At the core of this project lays the emergent concept of &#x27;slow memory&#x27;, that is intended to help us think from new angles about how societies and individuals remember the pasts that meaningfully affect their present and future. It begins from the premise that we are quite skilled (and have much practice) commemorating sudden or extreme events such as wars, atrocities or catastrophes. But we are less certain about how to reckon with slow-moving transformations that may be just as impactful, such as climate change, deindustrialization, or the gradual expansion of social and political rights.

I’m currently co-editing a special issue on Digital tools for the Journal of Digital History, which provides an innovative and multi-layered publication platform via Jupyter Notebooks. Full cfp can be found here.
The special issue welcomes contributions that introduce and discuss digital toolkits for exploring historic source materials, be they sonic, textual, visual, or audiovisual. We seek to collect a broad range of publications that demonstrate and critically analyse new ways of exploring the past through computational means and strive to open up and problematize the use of digital methods in historic research.
In line with the journal’s publication standards, the toolkits should be open source and the articles available in Jupyter Notebooks…</p>

The CLARIN and Libraries workshop took place at KB National Library of the Netherlands on 9 and 10 May 2022. This was the first workshop with the explicit aim of bringing together the CLARIN community across Europe and research libraries to discuss issues relating to the delivery of digital content for researchers, and to plan practical steps for future collaboration. 
There were 30 participants in the workshop, the majority with library-based roles, from 15 different European countries, which led to a stimulating and fruitful discussion. Participants were able to reflect on a number of major library initiatives (past, present and future) involving the delivery of textual content from large text collections. These projects, usua…</p>

        <p>Auf diesem Forum Z diskutieren wir gemeinsam den Umgang mit dem industriellen Kulturerbe. Ausgehend von der Mine Cockerill und diversen lokalen und regionalen Initiativen zum Erhalt des Industrieerbes im Minett blicken wir über die nahe Grenze ins lothringische Erzrevier und in die fernere Montanregion Erzgebirge.
Lors de ce Forum Z, nous discutons ensemble de la préservation du patrimoine culturel industriel. En partant de la mine Cockerill et de diverses initiatives locales et régionales pour préserver le patrimoine industriel du Minett, nous regardons de l&#x27;autre côté de la frontière vers le bassin ferrifère de la Lorraine et plus loin la région minière d&#x27;Erzgebirge.

        <p>Ensuring long-term access to digital data is often a difficult task: both hardware and code decay much more rapidly than many other means of information storage. Digital data created in the 1980s is frequently unreadable, whereas books and manuscripts written in the 980s are still legible. This session explores good practice in data preservation and</p>

        <p>The impact of well-crafted data visualisations has been well-documented historically. Florence Nightingale famously used charts to make her case for hospital hygiene in the Crimean War, while Dr John Snow’s bar charts of cholera deaths in London helped convince the authorities of the water-borne nature of the disease.

        <p>I’ve updated the GLAM Workbench’s harvest of OCRd text from Trove’s digitised periodicals. This is a completely fresh harvest, so should include any corrections made in recent months. It includes:
1,430 periodicals
OCRd text from 41,645 issues
About 9gb of text
The easiest way to explore the harvest is probably this human-readable list. The list of periodicals with OCRd text is also available as a CSV. You can find more details in the Trove journals section of the GLAM Workbench, and download the complete corpus from CloudStor.
Finding which periodical issues in Trove have OCRd text you can download is not as easy as it should be. The fullTextInd index doesn’t seem to distinguish between digitised works (with OCR)  and born-digital publications (like PDFs) without downloadable text. You ca…</p>

        <p>The digital representation and publishing of human history on the web has so far been stuck at the digital unlocking of collections of historical items. Those collections are described by metadata mostly for curation and for findability metadata that are put on the web in the manner of a library catalog. Usually, there is little on ‘aboutness’. This is unfortunate, as modern representations of knowledge and web-based interactive presentation techniques offer ample opportunities for a more complex representation and richer interaction with digital history. In this contribution, we argue for a history in digital data that is treated for what it is: an interpretation, like all history, while remaining traceable to its information carriers.

        <p>As part of my work on the Everyday Heritage project I’m looking at how we can make better use of digitised collections to explore the everyday experiences woven around places such as Parramatta Road in Sydney. For example, the NSW Postal Directories from 1886 to 1908 and 1909 to 1950 have been digitised by the State Library of NSW and made available through Trove.  The directories list residences and businesses by name and street location. Using them we can explore changes in the use of Parramatta Road across 60 years of history. But there’s a problem. While you can browse the directories page by page, searching is clunky. Trove’s main search indexes the contents of the directories by ‘article’. Each ‘article’ can be many pages long, so it’s difficult to focus in on the matching text. Clic…</p>

The violation of a country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty – an act in clear breach of the United Nations Charter – has shattered the shared framework of values and principles fostered by multilateralism after the Second World War in the hope of achieving world peace, while leading to an unprecedented outpouring of solidarity for Ukraine and the plight of its people from Western democracies and European and international organisations, including NATO, the UN, the European Union and the Council of Europe, and their Member States and…</p>

        <p>Drama Critiques’ dataset was produced as part of Mylène Maignant’s PhD project at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (Ulm) between 2018 and 2022. Her research aims to explore the reception of contemporary London theatre (2010 to 2020) by analysing a large corpus based on the reviews written by two distinct groups of theatre critics: the journalistic one on the one hand, and the digital one on the other hand (bloggers). By relying partly on the data made available by Theatre Record (https://www.theatrerecord.com/) and by automatically extracting the content of 28 blogs, we built a corpus constituting more than 40,000 theatre reviews. Only 36,000 are open access, as some of the bloggers have not given their authorisation yet. The purpose of this data collection consisted of exploring the similarities and differences between these two literary communities. We were interested in better understanding the cultural discourse both journalists and bloggers construct. Given the amount of data, we relied on digital technologies to investigate this field. Using various digital techniques, such as computational linguistics, sentiment analysis, and Geographic Information Systems, we conducted a number of different analyses to map this cultural phenomenon. If some publications have already tackled the literary theme of English digital theatre criticism, none of them have examined it from a computational perspective. Drama Critiques’ dataset is then the first corpus which not only offers so many contemporary reviews based on journalists and bloggers’ publications, but which also proposes a study of its content (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6799656).

Submission deadline: September 5, 2022
In recent years, digital publishing has increasingly acquired relevance in the Humanities. This is particularly the case for critical editions, which, notably when compared to print editions, can now profit from the flexibility of XML with TEI tag suite, full-text or faceted search functionalities, semantic annotations, named entity recognition and continuous improvement.
The use of cognitive computing techniques based on Artificial Intelligence for e.g. machine learning-based classification and natural language processing, is making the transcription of sources and ann…</p>

End-term Conference
The DLA Marbach (German Literature Archive Marbach), the Klassik Stiftung Weimar and the Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel are home to over 500 years of German and European cultural history. In 2013, these institutions joined forces to form the MWW Research Association, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. From the start, the MWW has been involved in digital collection research and since 2019, there has been a focus on the targeted development of needs-oriented digital services and model solutions.
After ten years of successful cooperation, in February 2024, the association will conclude its second phase of funding. The MWW will use this milestone as an opportunity…</p>

Punk Cubano is the first digital archive dedicated to Cuban punk culture. Published in Spanish in 2020, the site gives access to the music production of 26 Cuban bands, as well as to several short testimonials about the experience of being punk in the island. This archive serves a double purpose: to work as a tool for Cuban musicians to publish their music, and to make information about Cuban punk accessible to anyone with an interest in it. 
The site was curated and published by Dr. Carmen Torre Perez, with permission from the featured bands/individuals, and the pictures and video testimonials were taken/recorded by Samuel Reina Calvo.
 
Dr. Perez graduated from the Hispanic Studies program at Penn in 2022 and is currently lecuturer at Boston University.

National Epics will run from Albania and Algeria to Vietnam and Wales, an alphabetical organization that reproduces the sovereign, Olympian starkness of nationalism. Each National Epics author also contributes to nationalepics.com, initially by briefly discussing how a designated territorial space shapes or is shaped by &quot;epical&quot; texts that tell its story to the world. Collectively and cumulatively, we will help augment the emergent disciplinary field known as critical nationalism studies.
Nationalepics.com is developing in parallel with National Epics, a collaborative work of c. 83 or 84 chapters, to be published by Oxford University Press (UK) and edited by David Wallace. While National Epics suggests a stabilized outcome, a multi-volume book with reference value, nationalepics.com evokes the process of getting there, acknowledging that the nature and dynamics of nationalism, and the texts that serve or subvert it, never rest. And while most such large-scale projects develop behind closed doors, nationalepics.com aims to share resources and air critical issues along the way.

        <p>Detecting Genre in Pitchfork Reviews


Project Start Date: 

August, 2021



We analyze 23,000 reviews from Pitchfork.com to establish a network of over 7,000 artists based on their co-presence in reviews. We use Gephi&#x27;s (Louvain community detection) modularity class feature to sort the network into closely connected groups. However, because this process is non-deterministic, we improve on its results by running it 10,000 times. Using this novel &quot;metamodularity&quot; method we can show how often any two artists were sorted into the same group. For instance, the jazz musician Alice Coltrane was grouped with John Coltrane 10,000 times, with Sly and the Family Stone 4,939 times, and with Guns n’ Roses one time. With these data, we can visualize how the largely undifferentiated mass of artists fragments into more and more connected groups could be described as genres. 
While some of the genres suggested by this method are incredibly specific, one notable exception is the group of African American musicians, which is remarkably large and stable. The artists within it range from Flying Lotus to Motown legend Marvin Gaye to trap rapper Young Thug to R&amp;B singer-songwriter Sade to gangster rapper Tupac Shakur to funk innovators Funkadelic to cross-over hip hop star Cardi B. This is a far more capacious group than most rock clusters along aesthetic, market, and even historic grounds. This may reflect real world connections, yet it is also possible that this metamodularity difference reflects a bias at Pitchfork, where a (historically) rock-oriented hipster aesthetic and a (historically) largely white male audience may correspond to a relative lack of nuance when covering Black artists (historically). In any case, it is fair to say based on these data that Pitchfork has written about Black artists in a structurally unique way over the years relative to their coverage of white artists.

        <p>You might have noticed some changes to the web archives section of the GLAM Workbench.

I’m very excited to announce that the British Library is now sponsoring the web archives section! Many thanks to the British Library and the UK Web Archive for their support – it really makes a difference.
The web archives section was developed in 2020 with the support of the International Internet Preservation Consortium’s Discretionary Funding Programme, in collaboration with the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand. It’s intended to help historians, and other researchers, understand what sort of data is available through web archives, how to get it,  and what you can do with it. It provides a series of tools and examples that document existing AP…</p>

        <p>There’s lots of GLAM data out there if you know where to look! For the past few years I’ve been harvesting a list of datasets published by Australian galleries, libraries, archives, and museums through open government data portals. I’ve just updated the harvest and there’s now 463 datasets containing 1,192 files. There’s a human-readable version of the list that you can browse. If you just want the data you can download it as a CSV. Or if you’d like to search the list there’s a database version hosted on Glitch. The harvesting and processing code is available in this notebook.
The GLAM data from government portals section of the GLAM Workbench provides more information and a summary of results.  For example, here’s a list of the number of data files by GLAM institution.

        <p>The HistorESCH project is a collaboration between Nuit de la Culture and the PHACS-team of public historians at the University of Luxembourg to tell the history of the city through the personal memories and objects of the Escher community.
HistorESCH: Escher Geschichten a 25 Objeten erzielt is an exhibition that will celebrate a year of engagement with the Escher community. The first phase of this project involved community workshops and crowdsourcing to collect photographs of potential objects to present at this exhibition. The second phase consisted of the categorisation of these objects by our Citizen Historian Circle (CHiC) and an online vote to select the objects for the exhibition.
The everyday objects bear witness to a personal approach to history. They tell the story of workers, sportsmen, or the distant past of the city. The free exhibition will showcase 25 of the most popular objects in the Pop-Up store in the shopping street of Esch-sur-Alzette. Each visitor will receive an exhibition catalogue in their preferred language (French, Luxembourgish or English) to read the personal anecdote and historical context of the object.
 
Opening hours
2 – 24 September, Monday – Saturday from 13.00-18.00.
Free entrance.
Location
Pop-Up Store, 121 Rue de l&#x27;Alzette, 4011 Esch-sur-Alzette

        <p>The conference is organised by the C²DH within the context of the project &quot;Doing Experimental Media Archaeology: Practice &amp; Theory&quot; (DEMA), funded by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR).
There has been a growing interest in the use of experimental approaches to the study of media histories and their cultures. An increasing number of scholars researching at the intersection of media history and theory are breaking new ground while working with archival sources and artefacts in experimental ways, e.g. through historical re-enactments and hands-on simulations. In their 2014 essay “Experimental Media Archaeology: A Plea for New Directions”, Andreas Fickers and Annie van den Oever underline the heuristic potential of hands-on approaches for re-sensitising scholars to the materiality of …</p>

        <p>I’ve made a small change to the Zotero translator for the National Library of Australia’s catalogue. Now, if there’s a link to a digitised version of the work in Trove, that link will be saved in Zotero’s url field. This makes it quicker and easier to view digitised items – just click on the ‘URL’ label in Zotero to open the link.
It’s also handy if you’re viewing a digitised work in Trove and want to capture the metadata about it. Just click on the ‘View catalogue’ link in the details tab of a Trove item, then use Zotero to save the details from the catalogue.</p>

        <p>Katukinan, Arawan, and Harakmbut are small language families spoken in south-western Amazonia. These families have received some attention, but there are no consistently transcribed and machine-readable datasets available for them. We address this lacuna by introducing the first publicly available linguistic dataset of Arawan languages as the first part of the Katukinan-Arawan-Harakmbut Database, created with the goal of providing and regularly updating a list of lexical items in a consistent transcription and with cognacy annotation. The database is being developed to be used in quantitative and genealogical investigations.

Assistant Professor, Russian and East European Studies, University of Pennsylvania



D. Brian Kim is a specialist in Russian literature of the long nineteenth century, translation studies, and literary and cultural relationships between Russia, Western Europe, and East Asia. 
Dr. Kim&#x27;s research broadly asks how Russians viewed and engaged in communication across languages and cultures throughout history, both within the Russian Empire and beyond its borders, and what factors motivated writers, translators, and lexicographers as they pursued their work in transnational contexts. His current book project examines the cultures, practices, and ideologies of multilingualism in imperial Russia, focusing on the interplay between literature and education to investigate a national imaginary that sought to valorize foreign languages as a way to bridge various cultural gaps between Russia and points beyond.
At Penn, Dr. Kim regularly offers courses on nineteenth-century Russian literary and cultural history, including seminars on Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, as well as occasional seminars on such topics as Russian identity and its permutations in historical context, and the history and sociology of reading in imperial Russia.

Ph.D. Candidate, History



Aron Brouwer MA is a PhD student focusing on the history and practices of transnational fascism and anti-fascist activism. He received his B.A. and Research M.A. in History from the University of Amsterdam. Aron&#x27;s research interests include Interwar Europe, East Asian history, economic history, book history, and translation studies. At the University of Amsterdam, he published articles and chapters on the Armenian genocide (2014), new approaches in Digital Humanities (2014), Adolf Hitler (2014), and French Intellectual History (2016). His B.A. thesis on the ideological foundations of Hitler&#x27;s worldview received the National Bachelor Thesis Award as the best historical B.A. thesis in the Netherlands in 2015. 
Recently, Aron co-authored a popular historical biography on William of Orange (2017) and his  M.A. thesis, entitled Translating Hitler. Towards a Global Translation History of Mein Kampf, 1925-1945 (2019), compared all Chinese, Dutch, English, French and Italian translations of Hitler&#x27;s book and argued that all these texts were ideologically repacked and rhetorically reframed by the decision-makers involved.
At Penn, Aron published on transnational fascism and anti-fascist activism in Interwar France (2019) and his dissertation project examines what happens when politically sensitive texts become the subject of translation and the focus of ideological control.

His teaching and research interests focus on Shakespeare and early modern drama, the history of material texts, bibliography and editing, early modern political and religious debate, and digital humanities.
Prof. Lesser is a general editor of The Arden Shakespeare (fourth series), along with Peter Holland and Tiffany Stern. His latest book is Ghosts, Holes, Rips and Scrapes: Shakespeare in 1619, Bibliography in the Longue Durée (Penn Press, 2021), which was shortlisted for the DeLong Book History Prize from SHARP. Both of his previous monographs won the Elizabeth Dietz Award, presented annually by SEL: Studies in English Literature to the best book in Renaissance studies. Most recently, he published Hamlet after Q1: An Uncanny History of the Shakespearean Text (Penn Press, 2015); his first book was Renaissance Drama and the Politics of Publication: Readings in the English Book Trade (Cambridge University Press, 2004).
Prof. Lesser is the co-creator, with Alan B. Farmer, of one of the earliest and most widely used DH resources in early modern studies: DEEP: Database of Early English Playbooks, an online resource for studying the printing, publishing, and marketing of Renaissance drama. With Adam Hooks, he created the Shakespeare Census, an online database of all extant copies of Shakespeare editions before 1700. 
In 2019, he took over from Peter Stallybrass as Director of Penn&#x27;s long-running Workshop in the History of Material Texts.

        <p>The metadata for digitised books and journals in Trove can seem a bit sparse, but there’s quite a lot of useful metadata embedded within Trove’s web pages that isn’t displayed to users or made available through the Trove API. This notebook in the GLAM Workbench shows you how you can access it. To make it even easier, I’ve added a new endpoint to my Trove Proxy that returns the metadata in JSON format.
Just pass the url of a digitised book or journal as a parameter named url to https://trove-proxy.herokuapp.com/metadata/. For example:
https://trove-proxy.herokuapp.com/metadata/?url&#x3D;https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-2906940941

I’ve created a simple bookmarklet to make it simpler to open the proxy. To use it just:
Drag this link to your bookmarks toolbar: Get Trove work metadata
View a digitised book or journal in Trove.
Click on the bookmarklet to view the metadata in JSON format.
To view the JSON data in your browser you might need to install an extension like JSONView.</p>

        <p>I was looking at my Trove Newspapers Data Dashboard again last night trying to figure out why the number of newspaper articles from NSW seemed to have dropped by more than 700,000 since my harvesting began. It took me a while to figure out, but it seems that the search index was rebuilt on 31 May, and that caused some major shifts in the distribution of articles by state, as reported by the main result API. So the indexing of the articles changed, not the actual number of articles. Interestingly, the number of articles by state reported by the newspaper API doesn’t show the same fluctuations.

This adds another layer of complexity to understanding how Trove changes over time. To try and document such things, I’ve added a ‘Significant events’ section to the Dashboard. I’ve also included a new ‘Total articles by publication state’ section that compares results from the result and newspaper APIs. This should make it easier to identify such issues in the future.
Stay alert people – remember, search interfaces lie!</p>

Data
Weekly harvests of basic Trove newspaper data continue, there’s now about three months worth. You can view a summary of the harvested data through the brand new Trove Newspaper Data Dashboard. The Dashboard is generated from a Jupyter notebook and is updated whenever there’s a new data harvest.
There’s also weekly harvests of files digitised by the NAA, now 16 months worth of data.
Updated harvest of Trove public tags (Zenodo) – includes 2,201,090 unique public tags added to 9,370,614 resources in Trove between August 2008 and July 2022.

        <p>This special episode of the Price Lab Podcast is dedicated to our colleague and friend Scott Enderle who died on September 11, 2021. Scott was one of the DH Specialists associated with the Price Lab and a leading thinker and innovator in quantitative literary analysis. More importantly, he was simply one of the best people most of us knew. This episode combines some found audio of Scott talking about his work with thoughts and reflections from some of the people with whom he worked closely.
Content Warning: This episode is very different from the others. It is quite sad at times and it deals with the death of a beloved member of our community, Scott Enderle. We were so lucky to get to work with Scott everyday at Penn but his presence loomed large in digital humanities and he had friends, fans, and collaborators all over the world. We&#x27;re making this episode available for everyone but especially for those who knew and admired Scott.

        <p>The dataset covers a statistically representative quantitative questionnaire survey conducted with 430 children with the aim of assessing their knowledge, habits and attitudes towards wood and trees. The goal of the study was to examine the variables that affect environmental awareness and the use of wood in the future. The dataset contains 430 rows (participants) and 49 columns (variables). Data has a reuse potential in the fields of childhood pedagogy and environmental education research but also opens new ways for demonstrating the formula of statistical representativeness or machine-learning analyses such as clustering techniques, associative learning, or decision trees.

          <h3>Calling all Tasmanian historians – you can now save resources from Libraries Tasmania into Zotero!<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>
        </a>
        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://updates.timsherratt.org/>Tim Sherratt</a> |
          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>I’ve created a Zotero translator for the Libraries Tasmania catalogue. Using it, you can save metadata and digital resources to your own research database with a single click. Libraries Tasmania actually has three catalogues rolled into one – the main library catalogue, the Archives catalogue, and the Names Index. The translator works across all three. Features include:
Select and save items from a page of search results.
Save individual items across the full range of formats. (By default, individual records in the catalogue open in a modal overlay. For Zotero to recognise the item you need to click on the Permalink button and open the record on a separate page.)
Automatically download digital images and PDFs attached to records. This works when the record points to a particular page – it won’t download multiple images from a single link. However, if a record contains multiple links to digitised pages (such as the Convict records in the Names Index), you’ll get them all!
Fields in the Archives catalogue and Name Index that don’t map to Zotero properties are saved as key/value pairs in Zotero’s ‘Extra’ field

The translator is now included in the main Zotero repository so should install and update itself automatically. If the Zotero browser extension doesn’t seem to be detecting Libraries Tasmania items you can force an update by right clicking on the Zotero icon in your browser toolbar and clicking on Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Update translators.
My work on this translator was not entirely altruistic – it’s going to be very useful in the Everyday Heritage project as Kate Bagnall and I try to bring together sources relating to Chinese heritage in Tasmania.
But I’m also very happy to be able to update my spreadsheet of Zotero support in Australian GLAM organisations and put Libraries Tasmania in the green! #dhhacks</p>

New research experience has historical, legal focus



AD Banse examined the scrawled words on his screen and realized that after a few days of examining century-old documents, he was becoming more adept at deciphering the often faded, often perplexing handwriting and vernacular of the era.
“I think there’s both a challenge, as well as a riveting aspect, to it,” Banse said. “The most challenging aspect has been understanding sometimes illegible writing.”
What had him riveted was reading an enslaved person’s story from more than 50 pages of a habeas corpus petition.
“There are moments while I’m working where I’m taken aback, when I remember these are true stories of people who had to combat very difficult traumas in their lives,” Banse said.

        <p>My new research project on the writing a new history of Belgium in a digital world has 3 components:
A theoretical part on the content and structure of a new history based on the analysis and comparison of existing public histories of Belgium, Wallonia, Flanders and Ostbelgien. The methodology is based on both qualitative and quantitative discourse analysis.
An empirical part aiming at investigating the current representations of Belgium (basic narratives and factual knowledge) as well as the expectations in terms of themes, values and media for a 200(0) year history of Belgium among young Flemish, Walloon, Brussels and German-speaking Belgians.
A practical part focused on developing adequate communication tools on Belgian history in the digital age.

In anticipation to these festivities, KU Leuven Libraries, in collaboration with UCLouvain, is putting its academic collection in the spotlight. Thanks to the efforts of the past months and years, images of 2025 rare books published by Leuven professors have now been uploaded to the Lovaniensia platform.

        <p>Motifs in folktales and myths have been identified and articulated by scholars, and the computational identification and discovery of such motifs is an area of ongoing research. Achieving this goal means meeting scientific requirements (that methods be comparable and replicable) and requirements for collaboration (that multi-disciplinary teams can reliably access data). To support those requirements, access to consistent reference datasets is needed. Unfortunately, these datasets are not openly available in a format that supports their use in data science. Here we report work in progress toward this goal, having converted the Ashliman Folktexts collection into a public dataset of annotated tale texts. The data can be accessed at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6575263.

This latest impact story showcases the project ‘Privacy in Research: Asking the Right Questions’, an engaging response to the challenges faced by researchers working with sensitive data. Commended as best practice by the Council of Europe, the project team has developed a portfolio of modular and interactive educational materials designed to help researchers and students navigate the maze of privacy concerns when embarking on research involving personal data covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
The project is important in the context of open science and the FAIR principles, as it facilitates the responsible sharing and reuse of data that is relevant for a range of research areas, as well as clinical applications, artificial intelligence and education more widely.

        <p>The Charles Translator for Ukraine: A development by LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ

            
The automatic translator for Czech and Ukrainian, recently developed at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÚFAL) of Charles University, is now also available as a mobile application for Android. Users can download the Charles Translator for Ukraine app free of charge from the Google Play store. 
The translator was developed with support of the LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ, and runs on the LINDAT technical infrastructure. It was developed in record time after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent wave of refugees into the Czech Republic, and it has been freely available for non-commercial purposes since mid-March at https://translator.cuni.cz. The web service has logged almost a quarter of a million hits in April, which, together with the demand from owners of smart mobile devices running Android, has triggered the development of a mobile application. 
The application allows translation between Czech and Ukrainian in both audio and text form, and phonetic transcriptions between Latin and Cyrillic are available for translations. 
The release of the mobile application is a significant event in the historical context of research and development of machine translation at the ÚFAL and also at LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ. The importance of this moment was enhanced by the introduction of the new name of the Czech-Ukrainian translation system Charles Translator for Ukraine, thereby subscribing to the brand name Charles University. With the addition of translation pairs of languages, the name should be narrowed down to Charles Translator in the future, allowing the researchers from ÚFAL to combine this new translator, developed in connection with the war in Ukraine, with the existing translation service available in LINDAT for other languages.

        <p>I’ve created a Zotero translator for the Libraries Tasmania catalogue. Using it, you can save metadata and digital resources to your own research database with a single click. Libraries Tasmania actually has three catalogues rolled into one – the main library catalogue, the archives catalogue, and the names index. The translator works across all three. Features include:
Select and save items from a page of search results.
Save individual items across the full range of formats. (By default, individual records in the catalogue open in a modal overlay. For Zotero to recognise the item you need to click on the Permalink button and open the record on a separate page.)
Automatically download digital images and PDFs attached to records. This works when the record points to a particular page – it won’t download multiple images from a single link. However, if a record contains multiple links to digitised pages (such as the Convict records in the Names Index), you’ll get them all!
Fields in the Archives catalogue and Name Index that don’t map to Zotero properties are saved as key/value pairs in Zotero’s ‘Extra’ field

I’ve submitted the translator for inclusion in the official repository, but you’re welcome to take it for a test run in the meantime. Just follow these steps:
Find out where your Zotero data folder is. From Zotero go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Files and Folders and click on Show Data Directory.
Open the translator file here. Then right click and choose Save as, navigate to your Zotero data folder, and save it in the ‘translators’ folder.
Restart Zotero and your browser.
Head to the Libraries Tasmania catalogue and try it!
Let me know if you strike any problems. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>When women like two-time Nobel laureate Marie Skłodowska Curie appear in exhibitions on the history of technology and science, this might be a good sign for the visibility of women in STEM. However, it goes too far to take Curie’s presence as a proof for a gender sensitive museum practice. With initiatives like Queering Museums, museums start(ed) to discuss broader visions of gender diversity and queer(y)ing museum practices. But when and under what circumstances do museums begin to discuss what kind of gender knowledge they produce? How do museum makers reflect on gender gaps and biases in collections, exhibitions, and education, steering towards a more gender-informed museum making? Applying a Science and Technology Studies (STS) framework on selected case studies, this talk will discuss how museums put gender theory to practice and highlight the spatio-temporal situatedness of museum knowledge production about gender in historical perspective.

        <p>Introduction: This post introduces two tools developed by the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, LoGaRT and RISE with a focus on Asia and Eurasia. [...]The concept of LoGaRT - treating local gazetteers as “databases” by themselves - is an innovative and pertinent way to articulate the essence of the platform: providing opportunities for multi-level analysis from the close reading of the sources (using, for example, the carousel mode) to the large-scale, “bird’s eye view” of the materials across geographical and temporal boundaries. Local gazetteers are predominantly textual sources – this characteristic of the collection is reflected in the capabilities of LoGaRT as well, since some of its key capabilities include data search (using Chinese characters), collection and analysis, as well as tagging and dataset comparison. That said, LoGaRT also offers integrated visualization tools and supports the expansion of the collection and tagging features to the images used in a number of gazetteers. The opportunity to smoothly intertwine these visual and textual collections with Chinese historical maps (see CHMap) is an added, and much welcome, advantage of the tool, which helps to develop sophisticated and multifaceted analyses.

        <p>When Lee Vinsel and I started The Maintainers and wrote “The Innovation Delusion,” we brought our historical sensibilities to a project that we hoped would reach broader and more general audiences. In the process, we set aside some of the conventions of archive-based history and embraced approaches from different academic and non-academic fields. In this talk I’ll describe some of our choices, and how it led to some unexpected scholarly insights—and moments of joy.
 


 
Andrew Russell is a co-founder of The Maintainers with Lee Vinsel, in 2016. As a co-director, he works with Lee, Jessica, and Lauren on research projects, outreach, and a variety of organizational work that goes into maintaining the Maintainers. His background is in the history of technology, where he writes and teaches about subjects such as Internet history, technical standards, and technology in American life. He really enjoys seeing connections and patterns between maintenance in our personal lives and maintenance on broader scales, such as in organizations or state or national governments.

        <p>Failures and breakdowns constitute an important element in the fundamental relationship between users and technology, and maintenance and repair are fundamental practices in everyday life. Stephen Graham and Nigel Thrift (2007) highlighted that “repair and maintenance are not incidental activities. In many ways, they are the engine room of modern economies and societies”. However, we still know very little about the actual developments of repair practices in the past and today. In his essay “Rethinking repair”, Steven Jackson (2014) therefore called for what he coined “broken world thinking”. He argues that we should take “erosion, breakdown, and decay, rather than novelty, growth, and progress, as our starting points” when we want to study consumption and use. Broken world thinking is an …</p>

        <p>Soon after its creation in 2018 the Fondation Luxembourgeoise de la Mémoire de la Shoah asked the newly opened C²DH to conduct a doctoral research project on the “spoliation of Jewish property during World War II in Luxembourg”. The goal and methods of this project were slightly different from those of the Special Commission for the Study of the Spoliation of Jewish Property in Luxembourg during the war 1940-1945, which gave its final report to the Luxemburgish Government in 2009. The “road-book” of the project, in the form of a series of questions, was set by the convention that framed it, signed in 2019. But as the project unfolded, this frame had to evolve. Which sources were actually available? Which research question did we want to address? Which methods did we want to use?
This session of the Research Seminar will present how the project evolved since it started in January 2020 and which – sometimes very practical – challenges still lie ahead for its remaining 18 months.

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>The book explores the many opportunities and challenges that public history practitioners encounter in the field. Six years after the first edition, renewed attention is given to the increasingly international dimension of public history, its fast-changing digital practices, and the renewed debates on what it means to work for, on, with, and among the public.
Thomas Cauvin will present why we, more than ever, need accessible public history teaching resources and will explore some of the new chapters, projects and examples of the book. You can find more details on the book here. A discussion with audience will follow the author’s short presentation.

        <p>&quot;Barvalo&quot; ouvrira ses portes au Musée des Civilisations de l&#x27;Europe et de la Méditerranée le 10 mai 2023 à Marseille. L&#x27;exposition traitera de l&#x27;histoire des différents groupes romani (Roms, Gitans, Sinte, Manouches et Gens du Voyage) en Europe. Une histoire fortement teintée d&#x27;antitsiganisme. Conçue de manière collaborative par un groupe de 19 personnes d&#x27;origine romani et non romani, elle a permis au musée de mener en parallèle une réflexion sur ses collections en permettant de procéder à des acquisitions suggérées par le groupe ainsi qu&#x27;à une réindexation de ses fonds anciens.
En ne cédant pas à la tentation de la simplification et de l&#x27;homogénéisation pour parler des &quot;Tsiganités&quot;, le musée s&#x27;est ouvert également à la critique des musées d&#x27;ethnologie et de société en confiant à l&#x27;artist…</p>

        <p>La première exposition organisée au Bridderhaus, ancien hôpital de la ville (1873), renové et transformé en résidence d’artistes, est consacrée à un urbaniste qui a relevé un grand défi il y a presque cent ans : réinventer Esch-sur-Alzette en contrecarrant l’emprise croissante de l’industrie sur la capitale du Bassin minier luxembourgeois par un plan vert.
Le plan d’extension d’Esch-sur-Alzette réalisé en 1924-1925 par l’urbaniste allemand Josef Stübben (1845-1936) parvient à contrebalancer les grands espaces industriels qui encerclent la ville, dont trois usines sidérurgiques, par des parcs, des allées d’arbres, des promenades, des constructions aérées, de belles places publiques pour créer une ville inspirée des cités-jardins anglaises.

        <p>&quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it&quot;. How about playing with it?
Digital games are increasingly recognised as powerful educational tools, able to shape historical culture by attracting, engaging, and emotionally involving a wider audience.
The lecture series History @ Play focuses on the intersection between gaming and public history drawing from the experience of both scholars and game designers to explore the affordances of interactive narratives and digital games.
Visual designer Claudia Molinari and creative writer Matteo Pozzi from the award-winning indie gaming studio We are Müesli will discuss the challenges and opportunities of designing narrative games set in modern and contemporary history.
 
Tuesday, 14 June 2022

The lecture will be followed by a reception.

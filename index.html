        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://updates.timsherratt.org/>Tim Sherratt</a> |
          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>The Trove books section of the GLAM Workbench has been updated! There’s freshly-harvested data, as well as updated Python packages, integration with Reclaim Cloud, and automated Docker builds.
Included is a notebook to harvest details of all books available from Trove in digital form. This includes both digitised books, that have been scanned and OCRd, as well as born digital publications, such as PDFs and epubs. The definition of ‘books’ is pretty loose – I’ve harvested details of anything that has been assigned the format ‘Book’ in Trove, but this includes ephemera, such as posters, pamphlets, and advertising.
In the latest harvest, I ended up with details of 42,174 ‘books’. This includes some duplicates, because multiple metadata entries can point to the same digital object. I thought it was best to preserve the duplicates, rather than discard the metadata.
Once I’d harvested the details of the books, I tried to see if there was any OCRd text available for download. If there was, I saved it to a public folder on CloudStor. In total, I was able to download 26,762 files of OCRd text.

The easiest way to explore the books is using this searchable database. It’s created using Datasette and is running on Glitch. Full text search is available on the ‘title’ and ‘contributors’ fields, and you can filter on things like date, copyright status, number of pages, and whether OCRd text is available for download. If there is OCRd text, a direct link to the file on CloudStor is included. You can use the database to filter the titles, creating your own dataset that you can download in CSV or JSON format.
If you just want the full list of books as a CSV file, you can download it here. And if you want all the OCRd text, you can go straight to the public folder on CloudStor – there’s about 3.6gb of text files to explore! #dhhacks</p>

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>I’m just in the midst of updating my harvest of OCRd text from Trove’s digitised books (more about that soon!). But amongst the items catalogued as ‘books’ are a wide assortment of ephemera, posters, advertisements, and other oddities. There’s no consistent way of identifying these items through the search interface, but because I’ve found the number of pages in each ‘book’ as part of the harvesting process, I can limit results to items with just a single digitised page – there’s more than 1,500! To make it easy to explore this collection of odds and ends, I’ve downloaded all the single page images and compiled them into one big PDF with links back to their entries in Trove. Enjoy your browsing!

This is another example of the ways in which we can extend and enrich existing collection interfaces using simple technologies like PDFs and CSVs. We can create slices across existing categories to expose interesting features, and provide new entry points for researchers. Some other examples in the GLAM Workbench are the collection of editorial cartoons from The Bulletin, the list of Trove newspapers with non-English content, the harvest of ABC Radio National programs, and the recent collection of politicians talking about COVID. Let me know if you have any ideas for additional slices! #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Some good news on the funding front with the success of the Everyday Heritage project in the latest round of ARC Linkage grants. The project aims to look beyond the formal discourses of ‘national’ heritage to develop a more diverse range of heritage narratives. Working at the intersection of place, digital collections, and material culture, team members will develop a series of ‘heritage biographies’, that document everyday experience, and provide new models for the heritage sector.

Digital methods will play a major role in the project. I’ll be leading the ‘Heritage Hacks’ work package that will support the creation of the heritage biographies and develop a range of new tools and tutorials for use in heritage management contexts. All the tools, methods, and data generated through the project will be documented using Jupyter notebooks and published through the GLAM Workbench. Watch this space!
The project is led by Tracy Ireland (University of Canberra), with Jane Lydon (UWA), Kate Bagnall (UTAS), and me as chief investigators. Our industry partner is GML Heritage.</p>

        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://updates.timsherratt.org/>Tim Sherratt</a> |
          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>For a few years now I’ve been harvesting downloadable text from digitised periodicals in Trove and making it easily available for exploration and research. I’ve just completed the latest harvest – here’s the summary:
1,163 digitised periodicals had text available for download
Text was downloaded from 51,928 individual issues
Adding up to a total of around 12gb of text
If you want to dive straight in, here’s a list of all the harvested periodicals, with links to download a summary of available issues, as well as all the harvested text (there’s one file per issue). You’ll notice that the list includes a large number of parliamentary papers and government reports as well as published journals.

All of the harvested text is available from a public folder on CloudStor.
The harvesting process involves a few different steps:
First I generate a list of periodicals available in digital form from Trove. This includes digitised titles, as well as born-digital titles submitted through e-Legal Deposit. This produced a CSV file containing the details of 7,270 titles. See this notebook for details.
Then I work through this list of titles to find out how many issues of each title are available through Trove. This information isn’t accessible through the API, so I have to do some screen scraping.
Next I work through the list of issues and try to download the text contents. Most of the born-digital titles don’t have downloadable text.
Once I’ve downloaded all the text I can from a title, I create a CSV file for it that lists the available issues and notes whether text is available for each. This file is stored with the text on CloudStor.
Once I’ve checked all the titles, I generate another CSV file that lists the details of all the periodicals that have downloadable text.
The code to harvest and document the downloaded text is available in this notebook. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Longtime associated with its working-class history, the ”Red Esch” was also composed of a diversified bourgeoisie, as well as of a thriving middle-class.
This research attempts to provide for the first comprehensive class and cultural history, focusing exclusively on the middle-classes and bourgeoisie of early 20th century Esch-sur-Alzette.
Who were the members of the middle and upper classes? Where did they come from? What were their professional occupations? Which space, whether social, commercial and residential did they occupy within the city? In which ways did they contribute to the urban development, improvement and embellishment of Esch-sur-Alzette?
Through her presentation, Suzana Cascao  will introduce the audience to the work in progress, i.e, the ways in which she designed her research (including sources and methodology), conceptual issues, research questions, its limitations and goals.

        <p>The Trove Journals section of the GLAM Workbench includes a notebook that helps you download press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts by Australian federal politicians. These documents are compiled and published by the Parliamentary Library, and the details are regularly harvested into Trove.
Using this notebook, I’ve created a collection of documents that include the words ‘COVID’ or ‘Coronavirus’. It includes all the metadata from Trove, as well as the full text of each document downloaded from the Parliamentary Library. There’s 3,995 documents in total, covering the period up until early April 2021. You can download them all as a zip file (12 mb).

While I was compiling this dataset, I also made a few improvements to the notebook. You can now filter the results to weed out false positives, and identify duplicates. #dhhacks</p>

One of those, the traditional extra-curricular seminar series that was a coming together space for people at different stages of their career, had to go online. And […]</p>

        <p>Over the past fifteen years, maintenance and repair practices have gained increasing academic attention, but the literature in the fields of history and philosophy of technology, science and technology studies, sociology and anthropology of technology is still focused on invention and newness. Complementing recent calls for a history of technology-in-use (D. Edgerton), broken-world thinking (S. Jackson) and a history of technology “after innovation” (A. Russell &amp; L. Vinsel), we are working on the first systematic historical investigation of repair and maintenance in a Western consumer society.
In the spirit of chasing this turn, we have invited international scholars to present their own take on the histories of maintenance and repair. These range from considering the philosophical implica…</p>

        <p>I’ve always been interested in the way people add value to resources in Trove. OCR correction tends to get all the attention, but Trove users have also been busy organising resources using tags, lists, and comments. I used to refer to tagging quite often in presentations, pointing to the different ways they were used. For example, ‘TBD’ is a workflow marker, used by text correctors to label articles that are ‘To Be Done’. My favourite was ‘LRRSA’, one of the most heavily-used tags across the whole of Trove. What does it mean? It stands for the Light Rail Research Society of Australia, and the tag is used by members to mark items of shared interest. It’s a great example of how something as simple as plain text tags can be used to support collaboration and build communities.

        <p>Spring quarter gave me the first chance in a long while to take some time off. The first week of the quarter was my kids&#x27; spring break, which we spent in a cabin in the woods near Mt. Lassen with just the right amount of internet: enough to quietly keep an eye on email, not enough for Zoom. We&#x27;ve taken some other long weekends, and there&#x27;s been periods when school has been closed for one or more kids. Nonetheless, here&#x27;s where things stand at the end of spring quarter.

        <p>I’ve spent a lot of time this year working on ways of improving the GLAM Workbench’s documentation and its integration with other services. Last year I created OzGLAM Help to provide a space where users of GLAM collections could ask questions and share discoveries – including a dedicated GLAM Workbench channel. Earlier this year, I tweaked my Micro.blog powered updates to include a dedicated GLAM Workbench news feed. Now I’ve brought the two together! What does this mean?
Any GLAM Workbench news that I post to my updates feed is now automatically added to OzGLAM Help
Links are automatically added to items in the news feed that let you add comments or questions in OzGLAM Help
So now there’s two-way communication between the services providing more ways for people to discover and discuss how the GLAM Workbench can help them.</p>

        <p>I’ve started creating short videos to introduce or explain various components of the GLAM Workbench. The first video shows how you can visualise searches in Trove’s digitised newspapers using the latest version of QueryPic. It’s a useful introduction to the way access to collection data enables us to ask different types of questions of historical sources.


As with all GLAM Workbench resources, the video is openly-licensed – so feel free to stop it into your own course materials or workshops. It could, for example, provide an interesting little digital methods task in an Australian history unit.
I’ll be creating a second QueryPic video shortly, demonstrating how you can work with complex queries and differing timescales. Let me know if you find it useful, or if you have any ideas for future topics. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Zwangssoldaten, Malgré-Nous, Zwangsrekrutéiert – three regions, three terms, one fate? After the German invasion of its western neighbours, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg in 1940, the border regions reaching from Eastern Belgium over Luxembourg to Alsace-Lorraine were seen by the Third Reich as lost German territories that needed reintegration into the Reich. One part of that reintegration policy was recruiting the local female and male youth into German labour services and armed forces.
This workshop will present the recruitments in each of these areas and focus on their historical similarities and differences. Further,  it will analyse the etymology and the legal aspect of the different terms describing the recruits. The workshop’s emphasis is on the quantitative analysis of contemporary sources. How can certain sources for example help researchers to challenge persisting narratives and statistics, in order to give a clearer view of the numbers, the recruitment processes and the war experiences within Eastern Belgium, Alsace-Lorraine and Luxembourg?

        <p>By Ben Bakelaar and Caterina Agostini   IIIF is an acronym that stands for International Image Interoperability Format. An easy way to think of IIIF is like a webpage. A webpage is built with HTML, via hypertext markup language. It pulls together text, images, and other multimedia into a single view. In the same way, a IIIF object is built using JSON, and links together metadata and powerful image capabilities which allow institutions to deliver ultra-high resolution images quickly and efficiently to a IIIF viewer. Any image (and even audio and video) can become a IIIF object by building a manifest that uses the IIIF standard to describe its</p>

        <p>Introduction: This article explores the potential use of data-driven methods to visualise and interpret the impact of Western efforts to influence Cold War dynamics using a covert book distribution programme. Based on a documentary corpus connected to the 2013 book by Alfred Reisch, which documented efforts by the CIA to disseminate books in the Soviet Bloc in the period 1956-1971, the authors use the Tableau Public platform to re-assess information science methods for researching historical events. Their analysis suggests that books distributed did not tend to have a more obvious political slant, but were more likely to have a broader universalist outlook. While it skirts around some of the limitations of visualization (highlighted elsewhere by Drucker and others) it offers a solid introduction to the benefits of a data-driven approach to a general audience.</p>

        <p>An article written by Kate Bagnall and me has just been published in a special issue of the Journal of World History focusing on digital history. And it’s open access!
The article is ‘Missing Links: Data Stories from the Archive of British Settler Colonial Citizenship’. In it we document our efforts to assemble a number of different datasets relating to naturalization. Here’s the abstract:
Digitized sources and digital methods are changing the way that we do history. For historians of the British Empire, the digital age offers new possibilities for investigating the lives of those who moved around the empire and across the world. However, much discussion of the possibilities and problems of digital history have focused on the creation and use of full text resources, skipping over the analytical opportunities offered by the descriptive systems in which those texts are embedded. This article is an attempt to fill this gap by documenting a journey through archival data relating to nineteenth-century Chinese naturalization in the Pacific Rim settler colonies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. We argue that such data stories are critical if we are to understand both possibilities and pitfalls of research in digital collections.
There’s also an GitHub repository with code and data related to the article.</p>

The project is funded by Esch2022 ASBL.
Since the REMIX/Esch2022 project thematically includes the neighbouring regions in a comparative and transregional perspective, this lecture is dedicated to the environmental history of the Saar region.
On 29 June,  Markus Lay will present “The Romanticism of Hell”. Environmental History of the Saar-region in the 19th-century. In Imperial Germany, the industrial region along the Saar-River was the third most important of its kind. Surprisingly, there are not many papers to be found about its environmental history, despite an abundance of source material. The lecture will focus on the relatively new field of environmental justice and present case studies of environmental conflicts.
Markus Lay is office manager of Saarland’s historical commission and was fellow of the Hans-Blöcker-Foundation. His dissertational work focuses on the environmental history of the region during industrialisation. The “work-in-progress” is planned to be presented on umweltgeschichte.net as a Digital Public History project. In his Masters thesis he concentrated on Apiarian Societies and the spreading of apicultural innovations during the 18th and 19th century in Europe.

Community Open Principles: Before, During and After the Global Pandemic
Dr. Ana Persic, UNESCO,
Dr. Arianna Becerril García, AmeliCA,
Dr. Johanna Havemann, Open Science MOOC,
Osman Aldirdiri, AfricArXiv
When we talk about Open (Open Science, Open Data, Open Access) what do we mean? How can we navigate the different definitions of what it means to be a community and to be Open? How do we engage with communities and train members around Open? What evidence are we using of how we are addressing Open? How can we be more inclusive and align our Open principles to foster norms, incentives, and recognition? Have our understandings around Open shifted during the pandemic? 
This online webinar will address these questions via the experiences of invited open science communities, how they have designed and applied their open (science) principles before and during the pandemic, particularly with regard to outreach and training, while also looking out at the horizon, at a future beyond the pandemic. The webinar aims to include open (science) perspectives from a diverse group of communities, learn from their approaches, how they have evolved, and identify possible next steps that all, in our global community can consider.

        <p>QueryPic is a tool to visualise searches in Trove’s digitised newspapers. I created the first version way back in 2011, and since then it’s taken a number of different forms. The latest version introduces some new features:
Automatic query creation – construct your search in the Trove web interface, then just copy and paste the url into QueryPic. This means you can take advantage of Trove’s advanced search and facets to build complex queries.
Multiple time scales – previous versions only aggregated search results by year, but now you can also aggregate by month, or by day. QueryPic will automatically choose a time unit based on the date range of your query, but if you’re not happy with the result you can change it!
Links back to Trove – click on any of the points on the chart to search Trove within that time period. This enables you to zoom in and out of your results, from the high-level visualisation, to individual articles.

This version of QueryPic is built within a Jupyter notebook, and designed to run using Voila (which hides all the code and makes the notebook look like a web app). See the Trove Newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench for more information. If you’d like to give it a try, just click the button below to run it live using Binder.

This ambiguity has been observed by surveillance scholars for many years, David Lyon once describing the alternating ends of ‘care’ and ‘control’ which these technologies serve. Yet the study of …

        <p>Industrial films are a valuable resource for research in the field of cultural studies as they are both mediator and part of industrial culture. In the Saarland, as well as in the Greater Region as a whole, many industrial films were created throughout the last century. The industries treated include but are not limited to glass and porcelain manufacturing, brewing and viticulture as well as the iron, steel and coal industry. Looking at borders, this talk will focus on the heavy industries, in which geographical border crossings are rendered obligatory by ore and coal basins extending over national borders. However, geographical borders are only one of many types of borders which play an important role in the context of the heavy industry and are represented in respective industrial films.…</p>

        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://updates.timsherratt.org/>Tim Sherratt</a> |
          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>When the 1-click installer for Reclaim Cloud works its magic and turns GLAM Workbench repositories into your own, personal digital labs, it creates a new work directory mounted inside of your main Jupyter directory. This new directory is independent of the Docker image used to run Jupyter, so it’s a handy place to copy things if you ever want to update the Docker image. However, I just realised that there was a permissions problem with the work directory which meant you couldn’t write files to it from within Jupyter.
To fix the problem, I’ve added an extra line to the reclaim-manifest.jps config file to make the Jupyter user the owner of the work directory:
	- cmd[cp]: chown -R jovyan:jovyan /home/jovyan/work

This takes care of any new installations. If you have an existing installation, you can either just create a completely new environment using the updated config, or you can manually change the permissions:
Hover over the name of your environment in the control panel to display the option buttons.
Click on the Settings button. A new box will open at the bottom of the control panel with all the settings options.
Click on ‘SSH Access’ in the left hand menu of the settings box.
Click on the ‘SSH Connection’ tab.
Under ‘Web SSH’ click on the Connect button and select the default node.
A terminal session will open. At the command line enter the following:
	chown -R jovyan:jovyan /home/jovyan/work




Done! See the Using Reclaim Cloud section of the GLAM Workbench for more information.</p>

        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://updates.timsherratt.org/>Tim Sherratt</a> |
          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>I’ve been working on an essay for publication in a forthcoming edited collection. I wanted to explore how the practice of history in Australia had been changed by GLAM organisations making their collections available online – both the new possibilities that had emerged, and the problems that remained. In the end I focused on three areas – discovery, digitisation, and research infrastructure. If you’re interested, I’ve shared a preprint on Zenodo.
Here’s a taste:
Just twenty years ago, historical research often entailed long hours spent at a microfilm reader, browsing newspaper after newspaper in the hope of finding something relevant. The changes wrought by Trove, and other digital collections, seem revolutionary, but as with all revolutions there have been gains and losses. Alongside the wonders wrought by digitisation, this chapter has tried to highlight some of the paths not taken. The online resources we now use daily are not simply the products of technology – priorities have been set, funding has been distributed, decisions made about what to include and what to leave out. Cultural heritage collections are not just put online, they are placed within specific contexts of discovery and use. Each object, each version, each interface comes with a set of limitations and affordances that together determine what is possible. We do not know yet how these decisions will shape the sorts of histories that we write.
I enjoyed reminding myself about some early digital initiatives in the GLAM sector, but as is usual with these sorts of projects, I had to leave a lot out. It’s made me think about developing a larger project documenting our gains and losses.</p>

        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://updates.timsherratt.org/>Tim Sherratt</a> |
          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>Here’s a new little Python package that you might find useful. It simply takes a search url from Trove’s Newspapers &amp; Gazettes category and converts it into a set of parameters that you can use to request data from the Trove API. While some parameters are used both in the web interface and the API, there are a lot of variations – this package means you don’t have to keep track of all the differences!
It’s very simple to use.

The code for the parser has been basically lifted from the Trove Newspaper Harvester. I wanted to separate it out so that I could use it at various spots in the GLAM Workbench and in other projects.
This package, the documentation, and the tests were all created using nbdev, which is really quite a fun way to develop Python packages. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>I deliberately don’t keep any stats about GLAM Workbench visits, because I think they’re pretty meaningless. On the other hand, I’m always interested to see how often GLAM Workbench repositories are launched on Binder. Rather than just random clicks, these numbers represent the number of times users started new computing sessions using the GLAM Workbench. I just compiled these stats for the past year, and I was very pleased to see that the Web Archives section has been launched over 1,000 times in the past twelve months! The Trove Newspapers and Trove Newspaper Harvester repositories are also well used – on average these are both being launched more than once a day.

The GLAM Workbench is never going to attract massive numbers of users – it’s all about being there when a researcher needs help to use GLAM collections. One or two launches per day means one or two researchers from somewhere around the world are able to explore new datasets, or ask new questions. I think that’s pretty important.</p>

        <p>I’ve updated my harvest of Australian GLAM datasets from state/national government open data portals. There’s now 387 datasets, containing 1049 files (including 684 CSVs). There’s a list if you want to browse, and a CSV file if you want to download all the metadata. For more more information see the data portals section of the GLAM Workbench.

If you’re interested in finding out what’s inside all those 684 CVS files, take the GLAM CSV Explorer for a spin! It’s also been given a refresh, with new data and a new interface. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Today it often appears as though the European Union has entered existential crisis after decades of success, condemned by its adversaries as a bureaucratic monster eroding national sovereignty: at best wasteful, at worst dangerous. How did we reach this point and how has European integration impacted on ordinary people&#x27;s lives - not just in the member states, but also beyond?

        <p>The Austro-German philosopher Edmund Husserl (born in Proßnitz, today Prostějov in 1859, died in Freiburg in 1938) remains one of the most influential philosophers of our time. He is considered the founder of phenomenology, which became one of the most significant origins of what has come to be called ‘continental philosophy’.  An astonishingly diverse range of philosophers have been directly influenced by Husserl’s works. The phenomenological method continues to be one of the richest methodological resources for philosophical thinking and scientific research, also in interdisciplinary settings […]</p>

        <p>International Round Table: “Different Cultures in Digital History”
8 June 2021 at 2.30pm (CEST), online
The aim of the round table is to bring together specialists in digital history and experts who use digital tools in historical research and education. History as an academic field is undergoing major changes as a result of the transformative impact of digital technologies. These technologies affect the very nature of sources, the practice of data collection and processing, and also the way in which historical knowledge is acquired and disseminated. The task of defining “digital history” has given rise to much debate and discussion, but developing an understanding of the field and the wide-ranging potential for interaction between history and digital technologies can offer insights into t…</p>

Location
Online
Registration through the following link: Centre for Digital Humanities | CDH Webinar: &#x27;Mediating sustainable cities: a methodological approach&#x27;, presented by Paola Monachesi (uu.nl)
On 28 May, the Utrecht Centre for Digital Humanities organises a webinar in which Dr Paola Monachesi (Languages, Literature and Communication, Utrecht University) presents a podcast series under development focusing on her research on urban sustainable development.
Environmental sustainability
In her research, Monachesi takes a communication approach to urban sustainable development. She focuses on social behaviour analysed on the basis of communication arising from social media data. She claims that data ownership is key to digital and environmental sustainability.
Social media data
In this webinar Monachesi presents the computational methodology she developed to analyse social media data that exploits the linguistic, communicative and relational characteristics of the users. She focuses on two communities: creative migrants and elderly. In order to reveal the more implicit meaning of the data, she combines her quantitative analysis with a qualitative, thematic analysis in a novel mixed-method approach based on an explanatory sequential emergent design.
Podcast and debate
Attendants will listen to 3 podcasts of about 10-15 mins addressing the methodology. There will be space to ask questions and have a debate about the approach, results of the analysis and the relation between digital and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, there will be the possibility to comment and give feedback on the podcast series.</p>

          Reading time: 4 minutes </p>
        <p>Introduction: In this paper, Ehrlicher et al. follow a quantitative approach to unveil possible structural parallelisms between 13 comedies and 10 autos sacramentales written by Calderón de la Barca. Comedies are analyzed within a comparative framework, setting them against Spanish comedia nueva and French comedie precepts. Authors employ tool DramaAnalysis and statistics for their examination, focusing on: word frequency per subgenre, average number of characters, their variation and discourse distribution, etc. Autos sacramentales are also evaluated through these indicators. Regarding comedies, Ehrlicher et al.’s results show that Calderón: a) plays with units of space and time depending on creative and dramatic needs, b) does not follow French comedie conventions of character intervention or linkage, but c) does abide by its concept of structural symmetry. As for autos sacramentales, their findings brought forth that these have a similar length and character variation to comedies. However, they also identified the next difference: Calderón uses character co-presence in them to reinforce the message conveyed. Considering all this, authors confirm that Calderón’s comedies disassociate from classical notions of theatre – both Aristotelian and French –ideals. With respect to autos sacramentales, they believe further evaluation would be needed to verify ideas put forward and identify other structural patterns.</p>

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>If you work with the collections of the National Archives of Australia, you might find the RecordSearch section of the GLAM Workbench helpful. I’ve just updated the repository to add new options for running the notebooks, including 1-click installation on Reclaim Cloud. There’s also a few new notebooks.
New notebooks and datasets
Harvest details of all series in RecordSearch – get details of all series registered in RecordSearch, also generates a summary dataset with the total number of items digitised, described and in each access category
Exploring harvested series data  – generates some basic statistics from the harvest of series data
Summary data about all series in RecordSearch  (15mb CSV) – contains basic descriptive information about all the series currently registered on RecordSearch (May 2021) as well as the total number of items described, digitised, and in each access category

Updated
I’ve started (but not completed) updating all the notebooks in this repository to use my new RecordSearch Data Scraper. The new scraper is simpler and more efficient, and enables me to get rid of a lot of boilerplate code. Updated notebooks include:
Harvest items from a search in RecordSearch – save the results of an item search in RecordSearch as a downloadable dataset, you can also save images and PDFs from digitised files (PDF saving is new!)
Harvest files with the access status of ‘closed’ – find out what we’re not allowed to see by harvesting details of ‘closed’ files
Other updates include:
Python packages updated
Integration with Reclaim Cloud allowing 1-click installation of the whole repository and environment
Automatic creation of Docker images when the repository is updated
Updated README and repository index with list of all notebooks
Notebooks intended to run as apps now use Voila rather than Appmode for better integration with Jupyter Lab
requirements-unpinned.txt added to repository for people who want to develop the notebooks in their own clean environment
Hope you find these changes useful! #dhhacks</p>

        <p>The legacy of industrialisation has resulted in “place[s] longing for historical self-assurance” (Achim Saupe). The current focus on industrial heritage has resulted in efforts to preserve and reconstruct this heritage in its original state. This applies not only to the memory of former workplaces, homes and recreation areas in post-industrial places, but also to the biographies of entrepreneurs, industrial workers and their families. The preservation and musealisation of former industrial landscapes raise further questions about the authenticity of such places. Public history, and with it the representation of the industrial past in museums, exhibitions and events, is situated between “original” representation and recreated staging. Furthermore, and this has been accelerated by the COVID-…</p>

This book chapter describes a web-based tool called CATMA which  promises a &quot;low-threshold&quot; approach to digitally encoded text interpretation. CATMA has a long trajectory based on a &#x27;standoff&#x27; approach to markup, somewhat provocatively described by its creators as &quot;undogmatic&quot;, which stands in contrast to more established systems for text representation in digital scholarly editing and publishing such as XML markup, or the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Standoff markup involves applying numbers to each character of a text and then using those numbers as identifiers to store interpretation externally. This approach allows for &quot;multip…</p>

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>My program of rolling out new features and integrations across the GLAM Workbench continues. The latest section to be updated is the Web Archives section!
There are no new notebooks with this update, but some important changes under the hood. If you haven’t used it before, the Web Archives section contains 16 notebooks providing documentation, tools, apps, and examples to help you make use of web archives in your research. The notebooks are grouped by the following topics: Types of data, Harvesting data and creating datasets, and Exploring change over time.

I’ve updated all the Python packages used in this repository and changed the app-ified notebooks to run using Voila (which is better integrated with Jupyter Lab than Appmode). But most importantly, you can now install the repository into your own persistent environment using Reclaim Cloud or Docker.
As Christie Moffatt noted recently harvesting data from web archives can take a long time, and you might hit the limits of the free Binder service. These new integrations mean you don’t have to worry about your notebooks timing out. Just click on the Launch on Reclaim Cloud button and you can have your own fully-provisioned, persistent environment up and running in minutes!

This is possible because every change to the Web Archives repository now triggers the build of a new Docker image with all the software that you need pre-installed. You can also run this Docker image on your own computer, or using another cloud service.
The Web Archives section now includes documentation on running the notebooks using Binder, Reclaim, Cloud or Docker. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>There’s no doubt that Trove’s digitised newspapers have had a significant impact on the practice of history in Australia. But analysing that impact is difficult when Trove itself is always changing – more newspapers and articles are being added all the time.
In an attempt to chart the development of Trove, I’ve created a dataset that shows (approximately) when particular newspaper titles were first added. This gives a rough snapshot of what Trove contained at any point in the last 12 years.

I say approximately because the only public source of this information are web archives like the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine and Trove itself. By downloading captures of Trove’s browse page, I was able to extract a list of newspaper titles available when that capture was made. Depending on the frequency of captures, the titles may have been first made available some time earlier.
The method I used to create the dataset is documented in the Trove Newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench. I used the Internet Archive as my source rather than Trove just because there were more captures available. Most of the code I could conveniently copy from the Web Archives section of the GLAM Workbench, in particular the Find all the archived versions of a particular web page notebook.
The result was actually two datasets:
trove_newspaper_titles_2009_2021.csv  – complete dataset of captures and titles
trove_newspaper_titles_first_appearance_2009_2021.csv  – filtered dataset, showing only the first appearance of each title / place / date range combination
There’s also an alphabetical list of newspaper titles for easy browsing. The list shows the date of the capture in which the title was first recorded, as well as any changes to its date range. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Introduction: Among the most recent, currently ongoing, projects exploiting distant techniques reading there is the European Literary Text Collection (ELTeC), which is one of the main elements of the Distant Reading for European Literary History (COST Action CA16204, https://www.distant-reading.net/). Thanks to the contribution provided by four Working Groups (respectively dealing with Scholarly Resources, Methods and Tools, Literary Theory and History, and Dissemination: https://www.distant-reading.net/working-groups/ ), the project aims at providing at least 2,500 novels written in ten European languages with a range of Distant Reading computational tools and methodological strategies to approach them from various perspectives (textual, stylistic, topical, et similia). A full description of the objectives of the Action and of ELTeC can be found and read in the Memorandum of Understanding for the implementation of the COST Action “Distant Reading for European Literary History” (DISTANT-READING) CA 16204”, available at the link  https://e-services.cost.eu/files/domain_files/CA/Action_CA16204/mou/CA16204-e.pdf

        <p>Introduction: NLP modelling and tasks performed by them are becoming an integral part of our daily realities (everyday or research). A central concern of NLP research is that for many of their users, these models still largely operate as black boxes with limited reflections on why the model makes certain predictions, how their usage is skewed towards certain content types, what are the underlying social, cultural biases etc.  The open source Language Interoperability Tool  aim to change this for the better and brings transparency to the visualization and understanding of NLP models. The pre-print describing the tool comes with rich documentation and description of the tool (including case studies of different kinds) and gives us an honest SWOT analysis of it.</p>

        <p>Winter quarter was a time of consolidation and slow progress, without much to share by way of exciting new developments. I worked on a lot of things that I expect will bear fruit down the road, but I can&#x27;t point to anything concrete yet. Here&#x27;s where things stand as of spring break 2021.

With some advice from Matthew Lincoln at Carnegie Mellon, I&#x27;m close to finishing the migration of the Global Medieval Sourcebook into a Jekyll site fashioned after CMU&#x27;s DH Literacy Guidebook. It&#x27;s been a multi-step process, including some XSLT, some Python, some OpenRefine, and I&#x27;ve kept notes along the way. I&#x27;m planning to write it all up during the spring, if only as a set of tips for people considering migrating from Drupal to a static website.

        <p>Introduction: Standing for &#x27;Architecture of Knowledge&#x27;, ArCo is an open set of resources developed and managed by some Italian institutions, like the MiBAC (Minister for the Italian Cultural Heritage) and, within it, the ICCD - Institute of the General Catalogue and Documentation), and the CNR - Italian National Research Council. Through the application of eXtreme Design (XD), ArCO basically consists in an ontology network comprising seven modules (the arco, the core, the catalogue, the location, the denotative description, the context description, and the cultural event) and a set of LOD data comprising a huge amount of linked entities referring to the national Italian cultural resources, properties and events. Under constant refinement, ArCo represents an example of a &quot;robust Semantic Web resource&quot; (Carriero et al., 11) in the field of cultural heritage, along with other projects like, just to mention a couple of them, the Google Arts&amp;Culture (https://artsandculture.google.com/) or the Smithsonian American Art Museum (https://americanart.si.edu/about/lod).

        <p>The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) Awards Committee is seeking nominations for the 2022 Antonio Zampolli Prize.
The Zampolli Prize is a triennial award that recognizes a single output in the field of Digital Humanities by any scholar or scholars at any stage of their career(s). As such, it offers a unique opportunity to reward individual projects that either have been formative or had a decisive impact on the field as a whole. Because the prize is awarded to the overall project, the recipients can be a single individual or a collaborative group of scholars, researchers, and/or practitioners. The output recognized can take any form: published research, developed resources, an established initiative, and/or center or tool(s) for research, for example. To be eligible for the prize, the nominated project must involve the innovative scholarly use of information and communications technologies.
We urge you, as members of the field, to take this opportunity to offer recommendations for outstanding work that you feel deserves recognition. Nominations will be accepted until 23:59 UTC on 01 September 2021. A winner will be announced during the winter of 2021-2022 and the prize will be awarded at the 2022 DH conference.
Nominations should consist of a document (1500-2000 words) describing the work to be nominated and the individual(s) involved, paying special attention to the relevance and importance of this work to the field as a whole. Please include a brief description of the work, a discussion of its innovative use of information technology and, particularly, the importance of this project to the Digital Humanities. Self-nominations will not be accepted. Please address nominations to the ADHO Awards Committee and send electronic copies to awards [at] adho [dot] org.
Note: Any previous nominations should be resubmitted.
For further information, including the terms of the award and protocols for its selection, please visit ADHO’s Zampolli Prize web page.

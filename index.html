          Reading time: 20 minutes </p>
        <p>In this paper, we discuss how different types of automatic annotation of digitised newspaper articles can be integrated into the iterative questioning of the source material and the creation of research corpora out of a collection of unstructured texts (kept in a structured collection). We annotate a sizeable collection of Swiss press articles (183,270), extracted via the impresso interface1 using topic modelling (MALLET)2 as well as a naïve Bayes classifier (script by Milan van Lange).
The methodological discussion we propose is to explore how text mining can help identify historical discourses that are difficult to query with keywords because of their inherent ambiguity and how to grasp them in a large corpus. We argue that the automated annotations can provide a body of corroborating evidence of the searched discourse, to be used as an intermediary and heuristic analysis step.

        <p>You are still on time to register for a stall at the CLARIN Bazaar !!

            
You are still on time to register for a stall at the CLARIN Bazaar of CLARIN2021. The Bazaar is an informal space at the CLARIN Annual Conference where you can meet people from other centres and countries, find out about their work in progress, exchange ideas, and talk to people about future collaborations. The Bazaar will provide an informal setting for conversations with CLARIN people, and space to show your work to colleagues and virtually share relevant material. 
What&#x27;s the difference between a stall at the bazaar and a paper presentation?
At the Bazaar you can present work in progress, share experiences, ideas and visions, planning, and demonstrate smaller outputs of CLARIN work. A place in the Bazaar is not a formal presentation, and submissions (a title and a description of max 250 words) are not formally peer-reviewed, though checked for eligibility. 
The deadline for application is 20 September. Learn more and express your interest in participation.

        <p>When comparing topics between LDA models trained on different collections of text, it’s common for people to use the Jensen-Shannon divergence as a measure of the (dis)similarity between topics. However, this is complicated a bit if the two collections being compared have differences in their vocabularies (i.e., some word types may be present in one collection, but not the other).
For example, if collection 1 has vocabulary {a, b, c} and collection 2 has vocabulary {b, c, d}, then comparisons between topics trained on the different collections require a to be inserted into the topics from collection 2, and d to be inserted into the topics learned from collection 1. My guess is that most people just insert such words with probability of 0, but I haven’t been able to find a case where this is actually addressed in the paper.
I’m trying to think through the implications of how this issue might be handled and am looking for literature that addresses this in any way. Suggestions for stuff to read on this are highly appreciated—thanks!

        <p>This work presents an enriched version of the Parish Memories (1758–1761), an essential Portuguese historical source manually transcribed. It is enriched with annotations of named entities of the types PERSON, LOCATION, and ORGANIZATION. The annotation was done automatically for the whole collection where two researchers annotated a portion of it manually for evaluation purposes. In this dataset, we provide the tagged texts, the lists of extracted entities, and frequency counts. The corpus is useful for historians, allowing, for instance, comparative analyses between parishes and regions or to calculate the area of influence of a locality. The paper describes the creation and evaluation of the corpus, discusses its applications and limitations. This first release may be improved by other researchers interested in the historical source itself or in the technology employed in its annotation.

        <p>Late last year the Federal Government announced it was making an $8.9 million investment in HASS and Indigenous research infrastructure. This program is being managed by the ARDC and will lead to the development of a HASS Research Data Commons. According to the ARDC, a research data commons:
brings together people, skills, data, and related resources such as storage, compute, software, and models to enable researchers to conduct world class data-intensive research
Sounds awesome!
Based on scoping studies commissioned by the Department of Education, Skills, and Employment (which have not yet been made public), four activities were selected for initial funding under this program. Draft project plans for these four activities have now been released for public comment.

        <p>The reporting on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961 is considered one of the first international media events. At the same time, the trial marked a turning point in society&#x27;s examination of the Holocaust and was very much in the spirit of the Cold War. The two German states also regularly reported on the trial in various media. These contemporary video clips, audio documents and newspaper articles were researched, compiled and commented on in a two-year project with students of Public History at the FU Berlin. The results are presented in the form of a DVD.
The lecture traces the project from the idea to the implementation as a student project and presents the result in the form of the DVD.

        <p>During the last two decades, scholars have increasingly stressed the importance of culture in the history of European integration. Studies have unpacked the European Union’s attempts to sell the European project to audiences in the Member States and abroad, yet little is known about the role exhibitions played in this process. Developing stands and pavilions for regional, national and international exhibitions formed a significant strategy within the European cultural politics complex. My PhD thesis looks at the participation of the EU in the international exhibitions that hold the largest political and symbolic importance: World Expos.
In her thesis Anastasia Remes selects four pavilions as case studies: the European Coal and Steel Community pavilion in Brussels in 1958, the European Communities pavilion in Montreal in 1967, the European Community pavilion in Seville in 1992 and the EU pavilion in Shanghai in 2010. In this presentation, I will discuss how the European pavilions presented the EU at the various World Expos. I will expand on the three research questions that have driven my research: to what extent is the EU presented as a state, how is the EU’s global power constructed and how did the EU transform its message in engaging pavilions and exhibitions?

        <p>by Caterina Agostini and Francesca Giannetti Introduction Earlier this year, Rutgers was invited to become a participant in the beta evaluation of ITHAKA JSTOR’s Constellate, a text analysis and pedagogy platform. As a result, we have had early view into a rapidly evolving service that aims to advance text analytics pedagogy. While pedagogy is its main thrust at the moment, Constellate is a fairly complex offering that is structured around three “pillars”: data, pedagogy, and research. For readers who are familiar with JSTOR’s Data for Research (DfR) program, which has provided researchers with bibliographic metadata, unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams for JSTOR journals and books since</p>

        <p>Hello,
My name is Marie Bizais-Lillig. I work on a large body of medieval Chinese texts. I edit these texts in XML-TEI format. I have also used Blast-based scripts to identify cases of text reuse. I am not very satisfied with the results. The project that I lead, which is entitled CHI-KNOW-PO, is funded by the Institute of Advanced Studies of the University of Strasbourg (USIAS, France).
The CHI-KNOW-PO project aims to develop tools to identify cases of text reuse and thematic cooccurrences in a more efficient way. The team will be composed of two research assistants, one postdoctoral researcher and myself.
This message is meant to publicize the job offer related to the postdoctoral position.
I am looking for someone with experience in programming system design for text processing analysis…</p>

        <p>And kind of upset. I thought the reviews were rather harsh. They seemed to misunderstand and downplay the humanistic payoff of the paper, instead discounting the piece for not following a (IMO stale) intro-methods-results-conclusion rubric, with heavy citation to related methods, as if I were only developing new tools rather than deriving new historical insights from them. I’m not familiar with this event but I thought this was more computational humanities than computational social science or computer science. What disciplinary backgrounds do the reviewers hail from?
Congratulations, though, to those accepted, and thanks to the organisers for putting this together. Sorry for being a bit petty: I’ve just been rejected from ADHO a few times now, I think for being a bit too pitched to a computational-heavy audience, and now rejected from CHR, for being a bit too pitched to a humanistic audience, and wondering where my work even belongs anymore. But I will work to improve the piece and submit elsewhere.

CFP: The Art Museum in the Digital Age – 2022
The Belvedere Research Center is continuing its conference series on the digital transformation of art museums with its fourth event on the topic. The COVID-19 pandemic, and our resultant inability to experience proximity to people and objects, has given the matter additional ‘virulence’ in museums. Although the topic of digitization was gaining ground before the pandemic, the measures taken against the virus created a very special experimental arrangement in which the digital presence of museums was no longer merely a possible extension of exhibition spaces but rather the only w…</p>

        <p>Introduction: Among the Nominees in the &#x27;Best DH Dataset&#x27; of the DH Awards 2020, the TAO IC Project (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/index.html) leads us in a fascinating journey through the world of Chinese ceramics. The project, which is developed in a collaborative way at the Knowledge Engineering &amp; Terminology Research Center of Liaocheng (http://ketrc.com/), exploits an onto-terminology-based approach to build an e-dictionary of Chinese vessels. Do you want to know every detail about a ‘Double-gourd Vase I’? If you consult ‘Class’ in the ‘Ontology’ section (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/class.html), you can discover the component, the function, from what such a vessel is made of, and what is the method to fire it. If you also wish to see how the vase appears, under ‘Individuals’ of the same section you can read a full description of it and, also, see a picture (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/class.html).  All this information is collected in the e-dictionary for each beautiful item belonging to the Ming and Qing dynasties.

        <p>Existing text recognition engines enables to train general models to recognize not only one specific hand but a multitude of historical hands within a particular script, and from a rather large time period (more than 100 years). This paper compares different text recognition engines and their performance on a test set independent of the training and validation sets. We argue that both, test set and ground truth, should be made available by researchers as part of a shared task to allow for the comparison of engines. This will give insight into the range of possible options for institutions in need of recognition models. As a test set, we provide a data set consisting of 2,426 lines which have been randomly selected from meeting minutes of the Swiss Federal Council from 1848 to 1903. To our knowledge, neither the aforementioned text lines, which we take as ground truth, nor the multitude of different hands within this corpus have ever been used to train handwritten text recognition models. In addition, the data set used is perfect for making comparisons involving recognition engines and large training sets due to its variability and the time frame it spans. Consequently, this paper argues that both the tested engines, HTR+ and PyLaia, can handle large training sets. The resulting models have yielded very good results on a test set consisting of unknown but stylistically similar hands.

        <p>The Corpus for Idiolectal Research (CIDRE) is a collection of fiction works from 11 prolific 19th-century French authors (4 women, 7 men; 22–62 works/author; total of 37 million words). Every work is dated with the year it was written. Using programming scripts, the works have been gathered from open source platforms, for example La Bibliothèque électronique du Québec, and stripped of paratext (text not being part of the novel, e.g. prefaces). We distribute the text files, the dating, other metadata and the programming scripts under an open source license. CIDRE is the first resource of French for the study of style and idiolect in a diachronic manner (i.e. stylochronometry) on a larger scale.

        <p>This dataset contains information from more than 7,500 maritime pirate attacks that took place between January 1993 and December 2020, as well as country indicator data for the same time period. The pirate attack data was collected from the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), tidied, and augmented with geospatial data. The country indicator data was gathered from a variety of sources, notably The World Bank. The data is contained in Comma Separated Value (CSV) files. The reuse potential includes its use by anti-piracy organisations and researchers, as well as commercial businesses, in the understanding and prevention of maritime piracy. This dataset is available through Zenodo and Github.

        <p>The MuSe (Music Sentiment) dataset contains sentiment information for 90,001 songs. We computed scores for the affective dimensions of valence, dominance, and arousal, based on the user-generated tags that are available for each song via Last.fm. In addition, we provide artist, title and genre metadata, and a MusicBrainz ID and a
Spotify ID, which allow researchers to extend the dataset with further metadata.

          <h3>Development and Validation of a Corpus of Written Parliamentary Questions in the Hellenic Parliament<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

        <p>This paper presents the development of the first parliamentary corpus of written questions in the Hellenic Parliament. Moreover, we discuss a well-defined end-to-end process that has been streamlined and optimised to produce high-quality open text data based on parliamentary documents. Based on the above methodology, a representative sample of 2,000 questions from four parliamentary periods in the Hellenic Parliament has been extracted, validated, and placed into an open data repository. Furthermore, open data production is analysed, and several degrees of freedom in its application in alternative data sets are proposed and discussed. Consequently, the authors argue that this method constitutes a transferable and scalable practice that can be used by other representative institutions for the creation and subsequent study of their open data.

        <p>The dataset comprises text and metadata extracted from several hundred IT-blogs and websites, along with a method to duplicate the data by updating its contents and downloading it to the user’s local machine. The targets have been hand-picked with the intention to represent the discourse on blogs and websites dedicated to questions at the intersection of technology and society from Germany and the United States of America. The texts have been retrieved by web crawling techniques. The resulting corpus is accessible through a search platform and also reproducible with freely accessible descriptors and software.

        <p>The corpus “d-Prose 1870-1920” is a heterogeneous collection of 2511 German-language literary prose texts published between 1870 and 1920. It contains narrative texts from trivial and high literature with a minimum length of 1000 words. The texts are available as UTF-8 text files with an associated metadata table. These data are primarily of interest to literary scholars, linguists, but also for all those who are involved in the modelling of textual and cultural phenomena. The corpus can be used to test literary, literary-historical, cultural, and linguistic hypotheses.

        <p>The Index of Digital Humanities Conferences is a database of conference metadata relevant to the digital humanities community dating back to the 1960s. It includes details about hundreds of conferences, and for a subset of them, details about work presented at those events. Weingart, Eichmann-Kalwara, Lincoln, and research assistants collected information by hand or with machine assistance from paper programs, listserv announcements, published proceedings, PDF programs, and conference websites. Data are in CSV tables with a data dictionary describing how they can be linked together, for use by digital humanists and bibliometricians to study the history of the digital humanities community.

          <h3>Microscopic Views on a Global Pandemic: Social and Cultural Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic as Documented in Two Dutch Community Archives<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the obvious implications for public health and the economy at a global scale, has also had significant social and cultural effects: the partial or complete lockdown of public life breaks social and cultural networks and habits, and necessitates the invention of new forms of communication, contact, and inspiration. Over the course of the pandemic, various initiatives have emerged that have tried to capture this unique moment in history by collecting documentation on the social and cultural impact of the pandemic on people’s daily lives. Most of these collections were created bottom-up, either by actively approaching individuals or communities to contribute or be interviewed, or by opening platforms where citizens could directly contribute documentation. In this paper, we analyse two such citizen-generated collections of experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic: the ‘Corona in the City’ collection, assembled by the Amsterdam Museum for an online exhibition with the same title, and the ‘Dagboek Corona’ (Corona Diary) collection of diary contributions, assembled by the Dutch public historian and journalist José Boon. The paper discusses the background of these citizen-generated COVID-19 collections, assessing their scope and accessibility, and presenting a first, qualitative analysis of their content. We conclude with a reflection on the implications of the findings for people’s social life and identity, indicating how the datasets can be explored in further research and how the findings may benefit effective policy making.

        <p>We present the Game Walkthrough Corpus (GWTC), which contains 12,295 unique walkthrough documents covering 6,117 games. For each game walkthrough, we provide frequencies of unigrams and bigrams, treating the walkthrough document as a Bag of Words. In addition, we provide word frequencies at the sentence level. Furthermore, the GWTC contains a number of game-related metadata, including title, publisher, developer, year, and genre. All the language statistics and metadata are stored in separate plain text files and can be referenced through uniform resource names (URN). These URNs can also be used to derive any combination of statistics and metadata. Researchers, for instance, can investigate the most frequent unigrams for games in the “Adventure” genre. This way, the GWTC can be reused for different kinds of research questions on gaming language.

        <p>Over the last few weeks I’ve been updating my harvests of OCRd text from digitised books and periodicals in Trove. As part of the harvesting process, I’ve created lists of both that are available in digital form – this includes digitised works, as well as those that are born-digital (such as PDFs or epubs). I’ve published the full lists of books and periodicals as searchable databases to make them easy to explore.

One thing that you might notice is that works with the format ‘Government publication’ pop up in both lists – sometimes it’s not clear whether something is a ‘book’ or ‘periodical’. To make it easier to find these items, no matter what their format, I’ve combined data from my two harvests and created a searchable dataset of government publications. It includes links to download OCRd text from CloudStor if available.
All three databases make use of Datasette, which I’ve also used for the GLAM Name Index Search. One of the cool things about Datasette is that it provides it’s own API, so if you find some interesting in any of these databases, you can easily download the machine-readable data for further analysis. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>We’re in the midst of planning for the HASS Research Data Commons, which will deliver some much-needed investment in digital research infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences. Amongst the funded programs are tools for text analysis as part of the Linguistics Data Commons, and a platform for more advanced research using Trove. I’m hoping that this will be an opportunity to take stock of existing tools and resources, and build flexible pathways for researchers that enable them to collect, move, analyse, preserve, and share data across different platforms and services.
To this end, I thought it might be useful to try and summarise what the GLAM Workbench offers, particularly for Trove researchers. The GLAM Workbench doesn’t really have an institutional home, and is mostly unfunde…</p>

        <p>There’s a lot of rich historical data contained within the indexes that Australian GLAM organisations provide to help people navigate their records. These indexes, often created by volunteers, allow access by key fields such as name, date or location. They aid discovery, but also allow new forms of analysis and visualisation. Kate Bagnall and I wrote about some of the possibilities, and the difficulties, in this recently published article.
Many of these indexes can be downloaded from government data portals. The GLAM Workbench demonstrates how these can be harvested, and provides a list of available datasets to browse.

        <p>Academic Title: 

Fourth Year Ph.D. Student, History



Laura Newman Eckstein is a fouth-year Ph.D. student in history at the University of Pennsylvania. Her studies focus on Jews in the Atlantic world (17th-19th centuries) with specific interests in trade networks, material culture, book history, gender, race and digital humanities methodologies. Prior to her doctoral studies, she worked as the Judaica Digital Humanities Coordinator at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries.

        <p>The Trove books section of the GLAM Workbench has been updated! There’s freshly-harvested data, as well as updated Python packages, integration with Reclaim Cloud, and automated Docker builds.
Included is a notebook to harvest details of all books available from Trove in digital form. This includes both digitised books, that have been scanned and OCRd, as well as born digital publications, such as PDFs and epubs. The definition of ‘books’ is pretty loose – I’ve harvested details of anything that has been assigned the format ‘Book’ in Trove, but this includes ephemera, such as posters, pamphlets, and advertising.
In the latest harvest, I ended up with details of 42,174 ‘books’. This includes some duplicates, because multiple metadata entries can point to the same digital object. I thought it was best to preserve the duplicates, rather than discard the metadata.
Once I’d harvested the details of the books, I tried to see if there was any OCRd text available for download. If there was, I saved it to a public folder on CloudStor. In total, I was able to download 26,762 files of OCRd text.

The easiest way to explore the books is using this searchable database. It’s created using Datasette and is running on Glitch. Full text search is available on the ‘title’ and ‘contributors’ fields, and you can filter on things like date, copyright status, number of pages, and whether OCRd text is available for download. If there is OCRd text, a direct link to the file on CloudStor is included. You can use the database to filter the titles, creating your own dataset that you can download in CSV or JSON format.
If you just want the full list of books as a CSV file, you can download it here. And if you want all the OCRd text, you can go straight to the public folder on CloudStor – there’s about 3.6gb of text files to explore! #dhhacks</p>

        <p>I’m just in the midst of updating my harvest of OCRd text from Trove’s digitised books (more about that soon!). But amongst the items catalogued as ‘books’ are a wide assortment of ephemera, posters, advertisements, and other oddities. There’s no consistent way of identifying these items through the search interface, but because I’ve found the number of pages in each ‘book’ as part of the harvesting process, I can limit results to items with just a single digitised page – there’s more than 1,500! To make it easy to explore this collection of odds and ends, I’ve downloaded all the single page images and compiled them into one big PDF with links back to their entries in Trove. Enjoy your browsing!

This is another example of the ways in which we can extend and enrich existing collection interfaces using simple technologies like PDFs and CSVs. We can create slices across existing categories to expose interesting features, and provide new entry points for researchers. Some other examples in the GLAM Workbench are the collection of editorial cartoons from The Bulletin, the list of Trove newspapers with non-English content, the harvest of ABC Radio National programs, and the recent collection of politicians talking about COVID. Let me know if you have any ideas for additional slices! #dhhacks</p>

Ph.D. Candidate, English, University of Pennsylvania



Matthew Aiello is a Ph.D. Candidate in English at UPenn. His dissertation, Writing Under Duress: Trauma and Repetition in Early England, 1070-1270 treats trauma as a dynamic force that can be reconfigured as a tool of historical analysis for premodern texts while also exploring how trauma theory itself can be changed by the decentering agent of the premodern. His published work has appeared in Comitatus, Essays and Studies, Review of English Studies, and most recently in New Medieval Literatures.

        <p>Some good news on the funding front with the success of the Everyday Heritage project in the latest round of ARC Linkage grants. The project aims to look beyond the formal discourses of ‘national’ heritage to develop a more diverse range of heritage narratives. Working at the intersection of place, digital collections, and material culture, team members will develop a series of ‘heritage biographies’, that document everyday experience, and provide new models for the heritage sector.

Digital methods will play a major role in the project. I’ll be leading the ‘Heritage Hacks’ work package that will support the creation of the heritage biographies and develop a range of new tools and tutorials for use in heritage management contexts. All the tools, methods, and data generated through the project will be documented using Jupyter notebooks and published through the GLAM Workbench. Watch this space!
The project is led by Tracy Ireland (University of Canberra), with Jane Lydon (UWA), Kate Bagnall (UTAS), and me as chief investigators. Our industry partner is GML Heritage.</p>

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>For a few years now I’ve been harvesting downloadable text from digitised periodicals in Trove and making it easily available for exploration and research. I’ve just completed the latest harvest – here’s the summary:
1,163 digitised periodicals had text available for download
Text was downloaded from 51,928 individual issues
Adding up to a total of around 12gb of text
If you want to dive straight in, here’s a list of all the harvested periodicals, with links to download a summary of available issues, as well as all the harvested text (there’s one file per issue). You’ll notice that the list includes a large number of parliamentary papers and government reports as well as published journals.

All of the harvested text is available from a public folder on CloudStor.
The harvesting process involves a few different steps:
First I generate a list of periodicals available in digital form from Trove. This includes digitised titles, as well as born-digital titles submitted through e-Legal Deposit. This produced a CSV file containing the details of 7,270 titles. See this notebook for details.
Then I work through this list of titles to find out how many issues of each title are available through Trove. This information isn’t accessible through the API, so I have to do some screen scraping.
Next I work through the list of issues and try to download the text contents. Most of the born-digital titles don’t have downloadable text.
Once I’ve downloaded all the text I can from a title, I create a CSV file for it that lists the available issues and notes whether text is available for each. This file is stored with the text on CloudStor.
Once I’ve checked all the titles, I generate another CSV file that lists the details of all the periodicals that have downloadable text.
The code to harvest and document the downloaded text is available in this notebook. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Longtime associated with its working-class history, the ”Red Esch” was also composed of a diversified bourgeoisie, as well as of a thriving middle-class.
This research attempts to provide for the first comprehensive class and cultural history, focusing exclusively on the middle-classes and bourgeoisie of early 20th century Esch-sur-Alzette.
Who were the members of the middle and upper classes? Where did they come from? What were their professional occupations? Which space, whether social, commercial and residential did they occupy within the city? In which ways did they contribute to the urban development, improvement and embellishment of Esch-sur-Alzette?
Through her presentation, Suzana Cascao  will introduce the audience to the work in progress, i.e, the ways in which she designed her research (including sources and methodology), conceptual issues, research questions, its limitations and goals.

        <p>The Trove Journals section of the GLAM Workbench includes a notebook that helps you download press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts by Australian federal politicians. These documents are compiled and published by the Parliamentary Library, and the details are regularly harvested into Trove.
Using this notebook, I’ve created a collection of documents that include the words ‘COVID’ or ‘Coronavirus’. It includes all the metadata from Trove, as well as the full text of each document downloaded from the Parliamentary Library. There’s 3,995 documents in total, covering the period up until early April 2021. You can download them all as a zip file (12 mb).

While I was compiling this dataset, I also made a few improvements to the notebook. You can now filter the results to weed out false positives, and identify duplicates. #dhhacks</p>

Two years later, it&#x27;s time for another ACH write-up, with a very different point of comparison: !!Con, a tech conference celebrating &quot;the joy, excitement, and surprise of computing&quot;. While I&#x27;ve attended and presented at other virtual events this year (including the CSDH-SCHN conference), as co-VP of ACH I was particularly committed to attending as much of that conference as I could, and volunteering as a chair, online respondent, and livetweeter. !!Con was a more serendipitous discovery thanks to a tweet from Scott Weingart. It was the first non-academic conference I&#x27;ve presented at, and while differences in both scale and nature make it hard to compare …</p>

        <p>Over the past fifteen years, maintenance and repair practices have gained increasing academic attention, but the literature in the fields of history and philosophy of technology, science and technology studies, sociology and anthropology of technology is still focused on invention and newness. Complementing recent calls for a history of technology-in-use (D. Edgerton), broken-world thinking (S. Jackson) and a history of technology “after innovation” (A. Russell &amp; L. Vinsel), we are working on the first systematic historical investigation of repair and maintenance in a Western consumer society.
In the spirit of chasing this turn, we have invited international scholars to present their own take on the histories of maintenance and repair. These range from considering the philosophical implica…</p>

        <p>Tour de CLARIN:  The French CLARIN Knowledge Centre CORLI for Corpora, Languages and Interaction

            


Written by Eva Soroli
For most institutions, sharing knowledge means sharing declarative information: sharing data, metadata, tools (the “building blocks” of knowledge) and giving access to repository centres with such resources. However, accessing knowledge is not only about “knowing-what” can be collected, accessed or analyzed within a dataset but also refers to “knowing-how” a specific dataset is built, how it can be processed, for which purposes should it be created, used/re-used (“knowing-why”), and following which steps/procedures (“knowing-when”). The French Knowledge Centre CORLI for Corpora, Languages and Interaction (henceforth CORLI K-Centre) is such an attempt: a cer…</p>

        <p>CLARIN Resource Families: Dictionaries

            
The CLARIN Resource Families initiative provides a user-friendly overview of the available language resources in the CLARIN infrastructure for researchers from digital humanities, social sciences and human language technologies. 
This month CLARIN highlights dictionaries. Dictionaries were primarily created for human use (e.g., language learning/teaching, translation, lexicology) and are typically semasiological, which means that they are organized around words and contain information on their meanings, definitions, pronunciation, etc. 
There are 97 dictionaries in the CLARIN infrastructure. Most (57) of the dictionaries are monolingual, accounting for 14 languages. The rest (40) include a variety of both bilingual and multilingual language combinations. In the vast majority of cases, the dictionaries can be directly downloaded from the national repositories or queried through easy-to-use online search environments.

        <p>I’ve always been interested in the way people add value to resources in Trove. OCR correction tends to get all the attention, but Trove users have also been busy organising resources using tags, lists, and comments. I used to refer to tagging quite often in presentations, pointing to the different ways they were used. For example, ‘TBD’ is a workflow marker, used by text correctors to label articles that are ‘To Be Done’. My favourite was ‘LRRSA’, one of the most heavily-used tags across the whole of Trove. What does it mean? It stands for the Light Rail Research Society of Australia, and the tag is used by members to mark items of shared interest. It’s a great example of how something as simple as plain text tags can be used to support collaboration and build communities.

CLARIN ERIC is proud to announce that CLARIN Knowledge Centres CKCMC and  K-Dutch are officially recognized as CLARIN K-Centres.
The CLARIN Knowledge Centre for Computer-Mediated Communication and Social Media (CKCMC) offers expertise on language resources and technologies for Computer-Mediated Communication and Social Media. Its basic activities are to (1) give researchers, students, and other interested parties information about the available resources, technologies, and community activities, (2) support interested parties in producing, modifying or publishing relevant resources and technologies and (3) organize training activities.
Visit the CKCMC K-Centre
 
K-Dutch is the place for researchers who want to find out more about the Dutch language: linguistic properties, language advice, available tools and resources, etymology, dialects and many other things. K-Dutch is hosted by the Instituut voor de Nederlandse Taal (Dutch Language Institute), which is also a CLARIN-B centre and host of many tools, lexica and corpora for Dutch, which are, in general, freely available.

Becoming a K-Centre 
Have you considered to have your centre recognized as a CLARIN K-centre, either on your own or together with other partners (possibly in other countries)? You can do so with not too much effort, and you can do so even if you are not active in CLARIN yet, and even if you are not in a CLARIN member country. For more information about Knowledge centres and how to establish one, please have a look at the page on knowledge centres. It is also possible for an institution to join an existing distributed K-centre as one more partner if you have expertise in the same area.

        <p>Hi all,
Data-Sitters Club project, I’ve put together a short survey on Python vs. R for computational text analysis. We’ll be publishing one of our “books” on it towards the end of the summer. Fundamentally, the audience is people new to text analysis who are thinking about what programming language (if any) they should learn. If you have a few moments to share your thoughts in the survey, we’d be very appreciative!

        <p>A Recap on CLARIN Café: ParlaMint Unleashed

            
  
About
On the 28th of June the last CLARIN Café before the summer break was held. It was organised by Tomaž Erjavec (Jožef Stefan Institute), Darja Fišer (University of Ljubljana, Institute of Contemporary History and Jožef Stefan Institute), Maciej Ogrodniczuk (Institute of Computer Science, Polish Academy of Sciences) and Petya Osenova (Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgaria). This Café presented the results of the CLARIN-funded ParlaMint project, which harmonised parliamentary corpora for 17 countries and has provided data and tools for focused observations on trends, opinions, decisions on lockdowns and restrictive measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <p>Spring quarter gave me the first chance in a long while to take some time off. The first week of the quarter was my kids&#x27; spring break, which we spent in a cabin in the woods near Mt. Lassen with just the right amount of internet: enough to quietly keep an eye on email, not enough for Zoom. We&#x27;ve taken some other long weekends, and there&#x27;s been periods when school has been closed for one or more kids. Nonetheless, here&#x27;s where things stand at the end of spring quarter.

        <p>I know the Computer Vision for/with Humanities (data) community isn’t that well represented yet at CHR, and when reading the CFP I realised one way that might attract more publications from CV might be to adapt the short paper guideline. The main CV conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV) all follow the same policy with regards to dual/double submission (CMT submissions Website | CVPR 2021) which is typically followed by other CV conferences such as BMVC.
This policy doesn’t allow submission with substantial overlap; where substantial is defined as 20% or more, which is quite restrictive. But the policy also offers the great option in that papers of 4 pages or less are not considered publications, i.e.: “A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined to be a written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, was accepted.”. Explicitly accommodating this policy would make it more appealing for CV researchers that have a DH/CH leaning to submit to CHR, as it doesn’t involve choosing between venues.
I’m aware that the CFP defines short papers as ‘up to 3000 words (ca. 6 pages references, abstract and tables/illustrations excluded)’, so in theory one could submit a short paper of &lt;&#x3D; 4 pages. But 4 pages including abstract &amp; tables/figures is a lot shorter than the current ‘short paper’, and might require a different reviewing approach.
A different submission type, or shortening the short paper, would in my view make CHR more attractive for CV people. Although I understand this might go against the aim of attracting original research and to be a home for research that doesn’t fit elsewhere! Happy to hear thoughts on this.

        <p>I’ve spent a lot of time this year working on ways of improving the GLAM Workbench’s documentation and its integration with other services. Last year I created OzGLAM Help to provide a space where users of GLAM collections could ask questions and share discoveries – including a dedicated GLAM Workbench channel. Earlier this year, I tweaked my Micro.blog powered updates to include a dedicated GLAM Workbench news feed. Now I’ve brought the two together! What does this mean?
Any GLAM Workbench news that I post to my updates feed is now automatically added to OzGLAM Help
Links are automatically added to items in the news feed that let you add comments or questions in OzGLAM Help
So now there’s two-way communication between the services providing more ways for people to discover and discuss how the GLAM Workbench can help them.</p>

        <p>I’ve started creating short videos to introduce or explain various components of the GLAM Workbench. The first video shows how you can visualise searches in Trove’s digitised newspapers using the latest version of QueryPic. It’s a useful introduction to the way access to collection data enables us to ask different types of questions of historical sources.


As with all GLAM Workbench resources, the video is openly-licensed – so feel free to stop it into your own course materials or workshops. It could, for example, provide an interesting little digital methods task in an Australian history unit.
I’ll be creating a second QueryPic video shortly, demonstrating how you can work with complex queries and differing timescales. Let me know if you find it useful, or if you have any ideas for future topics. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Zwangssoldaten, Malgré-Nous, Zwangsrekrutéiert – three regions, three terms, one fate? After the German invasion of its western neighbours, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg in 1940, the border regions reaching from Eastern Belgium over Luxembourg to Alsace-Lorraine were seen by the Third Reich as lost German territories that needed reintegration into the Reich. One part of that reintegration policy was recruiting the local female and male youth into German labour services and armed forces.
This workshop will present the recruitments in each of these areas and focus on their historical similarities and differences. Further,  it will analyse the etymology and the legal aspect of the different terms describing the recruits. The workshop’s emphasis is on the quantitative analysis of contemporary sources. How can certain sources for example help researchers to challenge persisting narratives and statistics, in order to give a clearer view of the numbers, the recruitment processes and the war experiences within Eastern Belgium, Alsace-Lorraine and Luxembourg?

        <p>By Ben Bakelaar and Caterina Agostini   IIIF is an acronym that stands for International Image Interoperability Format. An easy way to think of IIIF is like a webpage. A webpage is built with HTML, via hypertext markup language. It pulls together text, images, and other multimedia into a single view. In the same way, a IIIF object is built using JSON, and links together metadata and powerful image capabilities which allow institutions to deliver ultra-high resolution images quickly and efficiently to a IIIF viewer. Any image (and even audio and video) can become a IIIF object by building a manifest that uses the IIIF standard to describe its</p>

        <p>Introduction: This article explores the potential use of data-driven methods to visualise and interpret the impact of Western efforts to influence Cold War dynamics using a covert book distribution programme. Based on a documentary corpus connected to the 2013 book by Alfred Reisch, which documented efforts by the CIA to disseminate books in the Soviet Bloc in the period 1956-1971, the authors use the Tableau Public platform to re-assess information science methods for researching historical events. Their analysis suggests that books distributed did not tend to have a more obvious political slant, but were more likely to have a broader universalist outlook. While it skirts around some of the limitations of visualization (highlighted elsewhere by Drucker and others) it offers a solid introduction to the benefits of a data-driven approach to a general audience.</p>

        <p>To help you make use of the GLAM Workbench, I’ve set up an ‘office hours’ time slot every Friday when people can book in for 30 minute chats via Zoom. Want to talk about how you might use the GLAM Workbench in your latest research project? Are you having trouble getting started with GLAM data? Or perhaps you have some ideas for future notebooks you’d like to share? Just click on the ‘Book a chat’ link in the GLAM Workbench, or head straight to the scheduling page to set up a time!

This is yet another experiment to see how I can support the use of GLAM data and the development of digital skills with the GLAM Workbench. Let me know if you think it’s worthwhile. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>An article written by Kate Bagnall and me has just been published in a special issue of the Journal of World History focusing on digital history. And it’s open access!
The article is ‘Missing Links: Data Stories from the Archive of British Settler Colonial Citizenship’. In it we document our efforts to assemble a number of different datasets relating to naturalization. Here’s the abstract:
Digitized sources and digital methods are changing the way that we do history. For historians of the British Empire, the digital age offers new possibilities for investigating the lives of those who moved around the empire and across the world. However, much discussion of the possibilities and problems of digital history have focused on the creation and use of full text resources, skipping over the analytical opportunities offered by the descriptive systems in which those texts are embedded. This article is an attempt to fill this gap by documenting a journey through archival data relating to nineteenth-century Chinese naturalization in the Pacific Rim settler colonies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. We argue that such data stories are critical if we are to understand both possibilities and pitfalls of research in digital collections.
There’s also an GitHub repository with code and data related to the article.</p>

Since the REMIX/Esch2022 project thematically includes the neighbouring regions in a comparative and transregional perspective, this lecture is dedicated to the environmental history of the Saar region.
On 29 June,  Markus Lay will present “The Romanticism of Hell”. Environmental History of the Saar-region in the 19th-century. In Imperial Germany, the industrial region along the Saar-River was the third most important of its kind. Surprisingly, there are not many papers to be found about its environmental history, despite an abundance of source material. The lecture will focus on the relatively new field of environmental justice and present case studies of environmental conflicts.
Markus Lay is office manager of Saarland’s historical commission and was fellow of the Hans-Blöcker-Foundation. His dissertational work focuses on the environmental history of the region during industrialisation. The “work-in-progress” is planned to be presented on umweltgeschichte.net as a Digital Public History project. In his Masters thesis he concentrated on Apiarian Societies and the spreading of apicultural innovations during the 18th and 19th century in Europe.

In particular, the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) allows for high quality images and supports a variety of uses and applications including deep zoom, comparison, annotation, and transcription of digital images. With the current pandemic limiting travel and access to libraries and museums, in the Spring 2021 we founded a new DH Special Interest Group at Rutgers focused on IIIF.

        <p>Community Open Principles: Before, During and After the Global Pandemic



The Force11 Working Group Reimagining Educational Practices for Open (REPO) will be hosting its second webinar on Jun 30, 2021 at 13:00 UTC.
Community Open Principles: Before, During and After the Global Pandemic
Dr. Ana Persic, UNESCO,
Dr. Arianna Becerril García, AmeliCA,
Dr. Johanna Havemann, Open Science MOOC,
Osman Aldirdiri, AfricArXiv
When we talk about Open (Open Science, Open Data, Open Access) what do we mean? How can we navigate the different definitions of what it means to be a community and to be Open? How do we engage with communities and train members around Open? What evidence are we using of how we are addressing Open? How can we be more inclusive and align our Open principles to foster norms, incentives, and recognition? Have our understandings around Open shifted during the pandemic? 
This online webinar will address these questions via the experiences of invited open science communities, how they have designed and applied their open (science) principles before and during the pandemic, particularly with regard to outreach and training, while also looking out at the horizon, at a future beyond the pandemic. The webinar aims to include open (science) perspectives from a diverse group of communities, learn from their approaches, how they have evolved, and identify possible next steps that all, in our global community can consider.

Wisnicki helps launch digital project to remake Victorian studies classrooms



Following the renewed calls for racial justice and the dismantling of systemic racism in 2020, a team of scholars, including the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Adrian Wisnicki, came together to re-imagine the way Victorian Studies is taught in classrooms.
This effort to help instructors teach Victorian Studies through a positive, race-conscious lens and go beyond the Anglo-European authors typically taught in Victorian literature courses, has manifested itself in a digital humanities project, “Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom.”

        <p>QueryPic is a tool to visualise searches in Trove’s digitised newspapers. I created the first version way back in 2011, and since then it’s taken a number of different forms. The latest version introduces some new features:
Automatic query creation – construct your search in the Trove web interface, then just copy and paste the url into QueryPic. This means you can take advantage of Trove’s advanced search and facets to build complex queries.
Multiple time scales – previous versions only aggregated search results by year, but now you can also aggregate by month, or by day. QueryPic will automatically choose a time unit based on the date range of your query, but if you’re not happy with the result you can change it!
Links back to Trove – click on any of the points on the chart to search Trove within that time period. This enables you to zoom in and out of your results, from the high-level visualisation, to individual articles.

This version of QueryPic is built within a Jupyter notebook, and designed to run using Voila (which hides all the code and makes the notebook look like a web app). See the Trove Newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench for more information. If you’d like to give it a try, just click the button below to run it live using Binder.

Hope you find it useful! #dhhacks</p>

My fellow panellists described some amazing stuff going on in European cultural heritage organisations to support researchers who want to make use of web archives. My ‘lab’ doesn’t have a physical presence, or an institutional home, but it does provide a starting point for researchers, and with the latest Reclaim Cloud and Docker integrations, everyone can have their own web archives lab! Here’s my 8 minute video. The slides are available here.</p>

        <p>Industrial films are a valuable resource for research in the field of cultural studies as they are both mediator and part of industrial culture. In the Saarland, as well as in the Greater Region as a whole, many industrial films were created throughout the last century. The industries treated include but are not limited to glass and porcelain manufacturing, brewing and viticulture as well as the iron, steel and coal industry. Looking at borders, this talk will focus on the heavy industries, in which geographical border crossings are rendered obligatory by ore and coal basins extending over national borders. However, geographical borders are only one of many types of borders which play an important role in the context of the heavy industry and are represented in respective industrial films.…</p>

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>When the 1-click installer for Reclaim Cloud works its magic and turns GLAM Workbench repositories into your own, personal digital labs, it creates a new work directory mounted inside of your main Jupyter directory. This new directory is independent of the Docker image used to run Jupyter, so it’s a handy place to copy things if you ever want to update the Docker image. However, I just realised that there was a permissions problem with the work directory which meant you couldn’t write files to it from within Jupyter.
To fix the problem, I’ve added an extra line to the reclaim-manifest.jps config file to make the Jupyter user the owner of the work directory:
	- cmd[cp]: chown -R jovyan:jovyan /home/jovyan/work

This takes care of any new installations. If you have an existing installation, you can either just create a completely new environment using the updated config, or you can manually change the permissions:
Hover over the name of your environment in the control panel to display the option buttons.
Click on the Settings button. A new box will open at the bottom of the control panel with all the settings options.
Click on ‘SSH Access’ in the left hand menu of the settings box.
Click on the ‘SSH Connection’ tab.
Under ‘Web SSH’ click on the Connect button and select the default node.
A terminal session will open. At the command line enter the following:
	chown -R jovyan:jovyan /home/jovyan/work




Done! See the Using Reclaim Cloud section of the GLAM Workbench for more information.</p>

        <p>I’ve been working on an essay for publication in a forthcoming edited collection. I wanted to explore how the practice of history in Australia had been changed by GLAM organisations making their collections available online – both the new possibilities that had emerged, and the problems that remained. In the end I focused on three areas – discovery, digitisation, and research infrastructure. If you’re interested, I’ve shared a preprint on Zenodo.
Here’s a taste:
Just twenty years ago, historical research often entailed long hours spent at a microfilm reader, browsing newspaper after newspaper in the hope of finding something relevant. The changes wrought by Trove, and other digital collections, seem revolutionary, but as with all revolutions there have been gains and losses. Alongside the wonders wrought by digitisation, this chapter has tried to highlight some of the paths not taken. The online resources we now use daily are not simply the products of technology – priorities have been set, funding has been distributed, decisions made about what to include and what to leave out. Cultural heritage collections are not just put online, they are placed within specific contexts of discovery and use. Each object, each version, each interface comes with a set of limitations and affordances that together determine what is possible. We do not know yet how these decisions will shape the sorts of histories that we write.
I enjoyed reminding myself about some early digital initiatives in the GLAM sector, but as is usual with these sorts of projects, I had to leave a lot out. It’s made me think about developing a larger project documenting our gains and losses.</p>

        <p>Here’s a new little Python package that you might find useful. It simply takes a search url from Trove’s Newspapers &amp; Gazettes category and converts it into a set of parameters that you can use to request data from the Trove API. While some parameters are used both in the web interface and the API, there are a lot of variations – this package means you don’t have to keep track of all the differences!
It’s very simple to use.

The code for the parser has been basically lifted from the Trove Newspaper Harvester. I wanted to separate it out so that I could use it at various spots in the GLAM Workbench and in other projects.
This package, the documentation, and the tests were all created using nbdev, which is really quite a fun way to develop Python packages. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>I deliberately don’t keep any stats about GLAM Workbench visits, because I think they’re pretty meaningless. On the other hand, I’m always interested to see how often GLAM Workbench repositories are launched on Binder. Rather than just random clicks, these numbers represent the number of times users started new computing sessions using the GLAM Workbench. I just compiled these stats for the past year, and I was very pleased to see that the Web Archives section has been launched over 1,000 times in the past twelve months! The Trove Newspapers and Trove Newspaper Harvester repositories are also well used – on average these are both being launched more than once a day.

The GLAM Workbench is never going to attract massive numbers of users – it’s all about being there when a researcher needs help to use GLAM collections. One or two launches per day means one or two researchers from somewhere around the world are able to explore new datasets, or ask new questions. I think that’s pretty important.</p>

        <p>Five of the GLAM Workbench repositories now have automatically built Docker images and 1-click integration with Reclaim Cloud – ANU Archives, Trove Newspapers, Trove Newspaper Harvester, NAA RecordSearch, &amp; Web Archives.

This means you can launch your very own version of these GLAM Workbench repositories in the cloud, where all your downloads and experiments will be saved! Find out more on the Using Reclaim Cloud page.</p>

        <p>I’ve updated my harvest of Australian GLAM datasets from state/national government open data portals. There’s now 387 datasets, containing 1049 files (including 684 CSVs). There’s a list if you want to browse, and a CSV file if you want to download all the metadata. For more more information see the data portals section of the GLAM Workbench.

If you’re interested in finding out what’s inside all those 684 CVS files, take the GLAM CSV Explorer for a spin! It’s also been given a refresh, with new data and a new interface. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Today it often appears as though the European Union has entered existential crisis after decades of success, condemned by its adversaries as a bureaucratic monster eroding national sovereignty: at best wasteful, at worst dangerous. How did we reach this point and how has European integration impacted on ordinary people&#x27;s lives - not just in the member states, but also beyond? This talk will present some of my recent book&#x27;s findings on the history of the EU.

8 June 2021 at 2.30pm (CEST), online
The aim of the round table is to bring together specialists in digital history and experts who use digital tools in historical research and education. History as an academic field is undergoing major changes as a result of the transformative impact of digital technologies. These technologies affect the very nature of sources, the practice of data collection and processing, and also the way in which historical knowledge is acquired and disseminated. The task of defining “digital history” has given rise to much debate and discussion, but developing an understanding of the field and the wide-ranging potential for interaction between history and digital technologies can offer insights into t…</p>

Registration through the following link: Centre for Digital Humanities | CDH Webinar: &#x27;Mediating sustainable cities: a methodological approach&#x27;, presented by Paola Monachesi (uu.nl)
On 28 May, the Utrecht Centre for Digital Humanities organises a webinar in which Dr Paola Monachesi (Languages, Literature and Communication, Utrecht University) presents a podcast series under development focusing on her research on urban sustainable development.
Environmental sustainability
In her research, Monachesi takes a communication approach to urban sustainable development. She focuses on social behaviour analysed on the basis of communication arising from social media data. She claims that data ownership is key to digital and environmental sustainability.
Social media data
In this webinar Monachesi presents the computational methodology she developed to analyse social media data that exploits the linguistic, communicative and relational characteristics of the users. She focuses on two communities: creative migrants and elderly. In order to reveal the more implicit meaning of the data, she combines her quantitative analysis with a qualitative, thematic analysis in a novel mixed-method approach based on an explanatory sequential emergent design.
Podcast and debate
Attendants will listen to 3 podcasts of about 10-15 mins addressing the methodology. There will be space to ask questions and have a debate about the approach, results of the analysis and the relation between digital and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, there will be the possibility to comment and give feedback on the podcast series.</p>

        <p>Introduction: In this paper, Ehrlicher et al. follow a quantitative approach to unveil possible structural parallelisms between 13 comedies and 10 autos sacramentales written by Calderón de la Barca. Comedies are analyzed within a comparative framework, setting them against Spanish comedia nueva and French comedie precepts. Authors employ tool DramaAnalysis and statistics for their examination, focusing on: word frequency per subgenre, average number of characters, their variation and discourse distribution, etc. Autos sacramentales are also evaluated through these indicators. Regarding comedies, Ehrlicher et al.’s results show that Calderón: a) plays with units of space and time depending on creative and dramatic needs, b) does not follow French comedie conventions of character intervention or linkage, but c) does abide by its concept of structural symmetry. As for autos sacramentales, their findings brought forth that these have a similar length and character variation to comedies. However, they also identified the next difference: Calderón uses character co-presence in them to reinforce the message conveyed. Considering all this, authors confirm that Calderón’s comedies disassociate from classical notions of theatre – both Aristotelian and French –ideals. With respect to autos sacramentales, they believe further evaluation would be needed to verify ideas put forward and identify other structural patterns.</p>

        <p>If you work with the collections of the National Archives of Australia, you might find the RecordSearch section of the GLAM Workbench helpful. I’ve just updated the repository to add new options for running the notebooks, including 1-click installation on Reclaim Cloud. There’s also a few new notebooks.
New notebooks and datasets
Harvest details of all series in RecordSearch – get details of all series registered in RecordSearch, also generates a summary dataset with the total number of items digitised, described and in each access category
Exploring harvested series data  – generates some basic statistics from the harvest of series data
Summary data about all series in RecordSearch  (15mb CSV) – contains basic descriptive information about all the series currently registered on RecordSearch (May 2021) as well as the total number of items described, digitised, and in each access category

Updated
I’ve started (but not completed) updating all the notebooks in this repository to use my new RecordSearch Data Scraper. The new scraper is simpler and more efficient, and enables me to get rid of a lot of boilerplate code. Updated notebooks include:
Harvest items from a search in RecordSearch – save the results of an item search in RecordSearch as a downloadable dataset, you can also save images and PDFs from digitised files (PDF saving is new!)
Harvest files with the access status of ‘closed’ – find out what we’re not allowed to see by harvesting details of ‘closed’ files
Other updates include:
Python packages updated
Integration with Reclaim Cloud allowing 1-click installation of the whole repository and environment
Automatic creation of Docker images when the repository is updated
Updated README and repository index with list of all notebooks
Notebooks intended to run as apps now use Voila rather than Appmode for better integration with Jupyter Lab
requirements-unpinned.txt added to repository for people who want to develop the notebooks in their own clean environment
Hope you find these changes useful! #dhhacks</p>

        <p>The legacy of industrialisation has resulted in “place[s] longing for historical self-assurance” (Achim Saupe). The current focus on industrial heritage has resulted in efforts to preserve and reconstruct this heritage in its original state. This applies not only to the memory of former workplaces, homes and recreation areas in post-industrial places, but also to the biographies of entrepreneurs, industrial workers and their families. The preservation and musealisation of former industrial landscapes raise further questions about the authenticity of such places. Public history, and with it the representation of the industrial past in museums, exhibitions and events, is situated between “original” representation and recreated staging. Furthermore, and this has been accelerated by the COVID-…</p>

The book focuses on two entities (long-form journalism and archives) which sit at the intersection between journalistic production and the digital.

        <p>For a paper I’m currently working on, I’m dealing with several types of Gaussian distributions that signal to onset and decay of an event. Events can have a slow onset and slow decay, resulting in a wide distribution, or they can have a fast onset and slow decay or vice versa. I’m exploring different ways to compare these distributions.
comparing the entropy of the distribution, which gives a general statistic
comparing the (linear) slopes of either side of distribution
calculating the skewness and kurtosis of the distributions.
I was wondering if others had pointers and possible feedback on the proposed methods.

        <p>Introduction: Digital Literary Studies has long engaged with the challenges in representing ambiguity, contradiction and polyvocal readings of literary texts. This book chapter describes a web-based tool called CATMA which  promises a &quot;low-threshold&quot; approach to digitally encoded text interpretation. CATMA has a long trajectory based on a &#x27;standoff&#x27; approach to markup, somewhat provocatively described by its creators as &quot;undogmatic&quot;, which stands in contrast to more established systems for text representation in digital scholarly editing and publishing such as XML markup, or the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Standoff markup involves applying numbers to each character of a text and then using those numbers as identifiers to store interpretation externally. This approach allows for &quot;multip…</p>

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>My program of rolling out new features and integrations across the GLAM Workbench continues. The latest section to be updated is the Web Archives section!
There are no new notebooks with this update, but some important changes under the hood. If you haven’t used it before, the Web Archives section contains 16 notebooks providing documentation, tools, apps, and examples to help you make use of web archives in your research. The notebooks are grouped by the following topics: Types of data, Harvesting data and creating datasets, and Exploring change over time.

I’ve updated all the Python packages used in this repository and changed the app-ified notebooks to run using Voila (which is better integrated with Jupyter Lab than Appmode). But most importantly, you can now install the repository into your own persistent environment using Reclaim Cloud or Docker.
As Christie Moffatt noted recently harvesting data from web archives can take a long time, and you might hit the limits of the free Binder service. These new integrations mean you don’t have to worry about your notebooks timing out. Just click on the Launch on Reclaim Cloud button and you can have your own fully-provisioned, persistent environment up and running in minutes!

This is possible because every change to the Web Archives repository now triggers the build of a new Docker image with all the software that you need pre-installed. You can also run this Docker image on your own computer, or using another cloud service.
The Web Archives section now includes documentation on running the notebooks using Binder, Reclaim, Cloud or Docker. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>The Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton is hiring a two-year professional specialist to work with our Humanities Computing Curriculum Committee (HC3). We’re a supportive, collaborative, transdisciplinary group that is working to integrate critical and humanistic methods with computer and data science in undergraduate courses. Because this position involves rethinking the ways computer science students are educated in history, culture, and ethics as part of their degree programs, we are especially welcoming of candidates who center issues of digital equity in their work.
Our review of portfolios (we’re asking for a cover letter and CV) will begin on June 11. An advanced degree (MA or above) in the humanities, social science, information science, or a related discipline is required. More information can be found at the job portal:

        <p>There’s no doubt that Trove’s digitised newspapers have had a significant impact on the practice of history in Australia. But analysing that impact is difficult when Trove itself is always changing – more newspapers and articles are being added all the time.
In an attempt to chart the development of Trove, I’ve created a dataset that shows (approximately) when particular newspaper titles were first added. This gives a rough snapshot of what Trove contained at any point in the last 12 years.

I say approximately because the only public source of this information are web archives like the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine and Trove itself. By downloading captures of Trove’s browse page, I was able to extract a list of newspaper titles available when that capture was made. Depending on the frequency of captures, the titles may have been first made available some time earlier.
The method I used to create the dataset is documented in the Trove Newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench. I used the Internet Archive as my source rather than Trove just because there were more captures available. Most of the code I could conveniently copy from the Web Archives section of the GLAM Workbench, in particular the Find all the archived versions of a particular web page notebook.
The result was actually two datasets:
trove_newspaper_titles_2009_2021.csv  – complete dataset of captures and titles
trove_newspaper_titles_first_appearance_2009_2021.csv  – filtered dataset, showing only the first appearance of each title / place / date range combination
There’s also an alphabetical list of newspaper titles for easy browsing. The list shows the date of the capture in which the title was first recorded, as well as any changes to its date range. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Introduction: Among the most recent, currently ongoing, projects exploiting distant techniques reading there is the European Literary Text Collection (ELTeC), which is one of the main elements of the Distant Reading for European Literary History (COST Action CA16204, https://www.distant-reading.net/). Thanks to the contribution provided by four Working Groups (respectively dealing with Scholarly Resources, Methods and Tools, Literary Theory and History, and Dissemination: https://www.distant-reading.net/working-groups/ ), the project aims at providing at least 2,500 novels written in ten European languages with a range of Distant Reading computational tools and methodological strategies to approach them from various perspectives (textual, stylistic, topical, et similia). A full description of the objectives of the Action and of ELTeC can be found and read in the Memorandum of Understanding for the implementation of the COST Action “Distant Reading for European Literary History” (DISTANT-READING) CA 16204”, available at the link  https://e-services.cost.eu/files/domain_files/CA/Action_CA16204/mou/CA16204-e.pdf

CLiC-it promotes and disseminates original research on all aspects of automatic language processing, both written and spoken, and targets state-of-the-art theoretical results, experimental methodologies, technologies, as well as application perspectives, which may contribute to the advancement of the CL and NLP fields.
The spirit of the conference is multi- and inter-disciplinary. Considering that the complexity of language phenomena needs cross-disciplinary competences, CLiC-it intends to bring together researchers of related disciplines such as Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Linguistics, Cognitive Science, Machine Learning, Computer Science, Knowledge Representation, Information Retrieval, and Digital Humanities. CLiC-it is open to contributions on all languages, with a particular emphasis on Italian.
CLiC-it is an initiative of the Italian Association of Computational Linguistics.
Please note that one of the track is dedicated to CL and NLP for the Humanities.

        <p>Introduction: NLP modelling and tasks performed by them are becoming an integral part of our daily realities (everyday or research). A central concern of NLP research is that for many of their users, these models still largely operate as black boxes with limited reflections on why the model makes certain predictions, how their usage is skewed towards certain content types, what are the underlying social, cultural biases etc.  The open source Language Interoperability Tool  aim to change this for the better and brings transparency to the visualization and understanding of NLP models. The pre-print describing the tool comes with rich documentation and description of the tool (including case studies of different kinds) and gives us an honest SWOT analysis of it.</p>

Working environment:
The CHI-KNOW-PO (Chinese Knowledge and Poetry) Project intends to explore the role played by poetry in the economy of knowledge in Medieval China. To do so, this project will investigate paths of circulation of snippets of knowledge and fragments of texts through a large diachronic corpus of Ancient and Medieval Chinese Texts in different genres down to the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The CHI-KNOW-PO project will  constitute and publish an open digital version of this body of texts in XML-TEI format (cf. a sample here: gitlab repository). Since existing tools can only spot lexical co-occurrences and calculate degrees of similarities through linear process, the project needs to develop new computational tools that will, for example, link synonyms…</p>

        <p>We invite contributions to the 1st Shared Task on automatic Scene Segmentation (STSS) for German narrative texts. Scenes are time-, location- and plot-wise coherent units of a story, and can predominantly be found in narrative texts like novels or biographies. Scene segmentation is needed for a high-level analysis of longer texts, but also for many areas of NLP that deal with longer narrative texts, since even modern methods struggle with processing text longer than a couple of sentences or paragraphs.
All the details can be found here: http://go.uniwue.de/stss2021, the shared task is co-located with KONVENS 2021: https://konvens2021.phil.hhu.de

They can be accessed online via the Findbuch.net-platform (https://www.archivverbund-bautzen.findbuch.net/php/main.php#3632313030). However, the statistics […]

        <p>The annual Digital Humanities conference coordinated by ADHO will not be held in 2021. ADHO’s Constituent Organizations Board has voted to focus efforts on supporting regional conferences currently coordinated by ADHO’s Constituent Organizations and their Associate Organizations and partners. To this end, we have dedicated dh2021.adho.org to providing information about the various virtual and in-person events being hosted throughout the year.
Stay tuned for more information about DH2022, to be held in Tokyo, Japan.

Thomas earns Lynton Prize for ‘A Question of Freedom’



William G. Thomas III has earned the Mark Lynton History Prize for his new book, “A Question of Freedom: The Families Who Challenged Slavery from the Nation’s Founding to the Civil War,” published by Yale University Press in November 2020.
The Lynton Prize honors the year’s best book-length work of narrative history on any subject that combines intellectual distinction with felicity of expression. It is one of four J. Anthony Lukas Prize Project awards that honor excellence in nonfiction writing and are given by the Columbia Journalism School and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. Past recipients of the Lynton Prize include Robert Caro, Isabel Wilkerson and Jill Lepore.

        <p>Winter quarter was a time of consolidation and slow progress, without much to share by way of exciting new developments. I worked on a lot of things that I expect will bear fruit down the road, but I can&#x27;t point to anything concrete yet. Here&#x27;s where things stand as of spring break 2021.
Existing Projects
With some advice from Matthew Lincoln at Carnegie Mellon, I&#x27;m close to finishing the migration of the Global Medieval Sourcebook into a Jekyll site fashioned after CMU&#x27;s DH Literacy Guidebook. It&#x27;s been a multi-step process, including some XSLT, some Python, some OpenRefine, and I&#x27;ve kept notes along the way. I&#x27;m planning to write it all up during the spring, if only as a set of tips for people considering migrating from Drupal to a static website.

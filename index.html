        <p>In his proposal for the Dartmouth summer research project (1955-1956), Nathaniel Rochester wondered whether injecting some randomness into a machine could make it creative. But how to control this randomness to prevent machines crashing and ensure the generated content’s relevance ? Seventy years later, the so-called « generative AI » seems to have solved the problem, or at least circumvented some obstacles. Despite the difficulty of estimating what goes on inside deep neural networks, we will briefly describe what « creativity » is about in generative AIs (interpolation in a latent space) and the current controversy over how to evaluate it using dedicated benchmarks. Then, drawing from literature and philosophy (Borges, Caillois, Bachelard), we will challenge the claim that it can be compared to human creativity. Finally, we will examine how these machines don’t have to be creative like humans to trigger an epochal change that we need to characterize.

        <p>Hey Australian Hansard fans, I’ve done a complete reharvest of all of the Commonwealth Hansard XML files from 1901 to 1980 from ParlInfo. There’s been lots of improvements/corrections, and most of the file names have changed (they now have a version flag). The improvements seem to be ongoing, so I’ll try to harvest more regularly from now on. You can download the lot from the GitHub repository.
I still need to load the updated XML into the Historic Hansard site, but that’s going to have to wait  for a month or two…</p>

        <p>I’ve just added a couple of new notebooks to the Trove Newspaper &amp; Gazette Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench.
Using the Trove Harvester as a Python package provides a basic example of using the trove-newspaper-harvester Python package. While there’s already a simple web app version of the harvester, I wanted a notebook version running in the JupyterLab interface that I could integrate with other tools and notebooks. All you need to do to harvest all the articles in a Trove newspaper search is paste in your Trove API key and the search query url from the Trove web interface.

Reshaping your newspaper harvest provides a slice and dice wonder tool for Trove newspaper harvests, enabling you to repackage OCRd text by decade, year, and  newspaper title. It saves the results as zip files, concatenated text files, or CSV files with embedded text. These repackaged slices should  suit a variety of text analysis tools and questions. I’ve be thinking about doing something like this for a while, and think it should be quite useful.
In my usual way, I started off writing a tutorial for the Trove Data Guide on ways of loading digitised newspaper data into text analysis tools and then realised I needed these notebooks to fill in some gaps in the data processing pipeline. So after a day or two of yak shaving I now have to get back to the tutorial.</p>

        <p>Do we play video games or do video games play us? Is nonhuman play a mere paradox or the future of gaming? And what do video games have to do with quantum theory? In the talk based on her book Playing at a Distance (MIT Press 2022), Sonia Fizek will engage with these questions, proposing new ways to think about games and play that decenter the human player and explore a variety of play formats and practices that require surprisingly little human action. Idling in clicker games, wandering in walking simulators, automating gameplay with bots, or simply watching games rather than playing them—Fizek will argue that these seemingly marginal cases are central to understanding how we play in the digital age.

Sonia Fizek is a media and games scholar. She holds a professorship in Media and Game Studies at the Cologne Game Lab at TH Köln – University of Applied Sciences. Fizek is also a visiting professor at the University of Lower Silesia in Wroclaw (Poland)  and a co-editor-in-chief of the international Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds. In her latest book Playing at a Distance (MIT Press 2022), she explores the borderlands of video game aesthetic with focus on automation, AI and posthuman forms of play. Fizek’s current research concentrates on the environmental aspects of video games. She participates in two international projects: “STRATEGIES – Sustainable Transition for Europe’s Game Industries” (2024-2027), and “Greening Games. Building Higher Education Resources for Sustainable Video Game Production, Design &amp; Critical Game Studies” (2021-2024).

        <p>Entreprendre une histoire des inégalités pour un petit pays transnational, caractérisé par le secret fiscal et la consultation après un délai de 100 ans des données fiscales, invite à analyser sur le temps long, les sources et archives en présence : recensements, listes électorales, archives notariales, cadastres, journaux, enquêtes, statistiques, rapports d’observatoires, d’associations, d’institutions comme les archives de Chambres professionnelles.
Toutes ces sources fournissent des informations sur divers espaces, acteurs et groupes sociaux, et contribuent à évaluer la répartition des richesses, les conditions de vie, les écarts de revenus, les privilèges et discriminations.
Comparer les inégalités – principalement de revenu et de patrimoine – qui en découlent, permet de comprendre leu…</p>

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>Last week I added a notebook to the GLAM Workbench that saves a collection of images from Trove as an IIIF manifest. This week I’ve written a tutorial that shows how you can use the notebook to load the collection data in Tropy – a desktop tool for managing and annotating images for research.

This is the first tutorial in the Trove Data Guide’s Research Pathways section. While most of the TDG documents the types of data available in Trove and how you can access it, the pathways aim to connect Trove data with other tools and platforms – to point at possibilities for analysis, enrichment, and sharing. For example, I’m planning tutorials on packaging OCRd text from Trove for use with text analysis tools, as well as ways of sharing selected data through tools like CollectionBuilder, and Datasette.
If you have any ideas for additional tutorials, feel free to add them to the ideas board in GitHub.</p>

        <p>The Family of Man was an exhibition of some five hundred photographs from around the world, curated by Edward Steichen for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York in 1955. After its installation at MoMA, and under the auspices of the United States Information Agency, copies of the exhibition then toured close to fifty countries. By the end of its international tour the exhibition had been seen by almost ten million people, making it the most successful event of the early decades of the cultural Cold War. This paper will consider the international reception of The Family of Man. Taking India and Japan as case studies, it will suggest the ways in which intersection of Steichen’s work and conception with local social and political circumstances inflected and reshaped the meanings of the exhibition.

        <p>I’ve just added a new notebook to the Trove images section of the GLAM Workbench. It helps you save a collection of digitised images as an IIIF manifest. But what does that mean? It means the notebook packages up all the metadata describing the images in a standard form that can be used with a variety of IIIF-compliant tools. These tools let you do things with the collections that you can’t do in Trove’s own interface.
Perhaps you’d like to browse the complete digitised contents of Sir Edmund Barton’s manuscript collection, without all the back and forth and up and down navigation imposed by the Trove web interface. Here you go, thanks to IIIF!

Digital Humanities Summer Fellowships awarded to four doctoral students



The Center for Digital Research in the Humanities announced its 2024 cohort of Digital Humanities Summer Fellows.
“This year we had the highest number of applications we’ve ever received, with lots of amazing, meritorious projects,” said Carrie Heitman, associate director and fellow of the CDRH and director of the 2024 Digital Humanities Summer Fellowships.
According to Heitman, the selection process was extremely difficult, but she had help from the other members of the CDRH’s Student-Centered Committee who reviewed the applications with her. Kevin McMullen, Katrina Jagodinsky, and Laura Weakly helped Heitman bring together a dynamic group of young scholars who will continue to push the field of…</p>

It’s assembled a collection of more than 80,000 archived website titles, organised into subjects and collections.

Trove’s digitised collection viewer includes a download option. But in most cases that seems to be limited to downloading 20 images at a time. Part of the reason for that is probably because the images are zipped up into a single file, which could get very large if 100, or 200 images were added.
Another limitation of the built-in download option is that the images are often fairly low resolution copies (many have a maximum width of 1000px). The…</p>

        <p>&#x27;Biographies of Struggle&#x27; is a documentary on a drawn-out unrest that took place at the ThyssenKrupp-AST-Terni steelworks in Central Italy in 2014, one of the longest steelworkers’ strike in Italy since the last wave of labour unrest in the ‘80s. Threatened by 550 job cuts and a partial closure, the Terni factory is the framework in which 11 participants express their discordant thoughts and opinions about the ongoing 7-months-long dispute, and 45-days-long strike. Drawing on their biographies and work experiences, the protagonists depict a fragmented portrait of one of the oldest Italian working class communities, while fighting mass layoffs.
This documentary is inscribed in an ethnographic research which addresses the ways in which labour activism contributes to the articulation of worki…</p>

        <p>La Revue d’Histoire de la Shoah présente un ample dossier consacré à un pays dont le statut pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale et la relation avec sa minorité juive sont très particuliers : le Grand-duché de Luxembourg. Au carrefour de la France, de la Belgique et de l’Allemagne, on estime actuellement que près de 5.000 personnes considérées comme juives y vivaient avant l’invasion allemande du 10 mai 1940 ; d’après l’état actuel des recherches, 1.227 sont mortes après avoir été déportées de Luxembourg, Belgique et France ; moins de 1.000 revinrent après la guerre au Luxembourg.

        <p>Remnants of material and visual cultures throughout history can be traced as millions of museum objects have been, and are, digitised and published online. The metadata of these online museum objects can be used as data to analyse the development of concepts, events or technological and social innovations in history by using information retrieval, quantitative and machine learning methods. They can also be used as primary sources to trace the history of and changes in the representation of concepts or events and their interpretation. How do online museum catalogue data reflect multiple perspectives on specific topics? Objects relating to, for example, female labour or ethnic minorities can be described in online catalogue metadata in a variety of ways. A drawing of an old Jew may be repres…</p>

        <p>Developed as part of the Land of Memory Interreg project, “Before the War” is a historical strategy board game that aims to provide an understanding of the issues and mechanisms related to wars. Players explore scenarios inspired by real-life historical events, and are given the chance to make crucial decisions and potentially rewrite history. World balance depends on the players’ ability to navigate diplomatic crises and maintain peace.
Project coordinator Mélanie Petton and game designer Vincenzo Bianca will illustrate the game development process and share their insights on how play can provide an original approach to exploring and understanding complex political dynamics and societal issues.

        <p>The ProviLux research project focuses on the issue of looted cultural property in the collections of three institutions in Luxembourg: the National Library, the National Museum, and the Villa Vauban Art Collection, part of the City Museum of Luxembourg (Les 2 Musées de la Ville de Luxembourg). The signing of an agreement between the Jewish Consistory and the State of Luxembourg on January 27, 2021, marked a key moment in the launch of provenance research in the country&#x27;s major cultural institutions. This initiative involves mapping wartime acquisitions, examining archival documentation and the provenance of art objects, and evaluating the data collected during the pilot phase of the ProviLux project.

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>In my work on the Trove Data Guide I’ve started sketching out a series of research pathways. These are intended as ways of connecting Trove data to tools and questions – providing examples of the steps involved in gathering, preparing, and using data to explore particular research topics.
I’ve currently defined six pathways, roughly based on different types of data that you can get from Trove:
Text
Images
Structured data
Maps and places
Networks and relationships
Creating collections
‘Creating collections’ is a bit different I suppose, as it’s meant to relate to the work of assembling research collections from data in Trove – for example, creating a collection of annotated newspaper articles in Omeka.
I have some ideas, of course, about the types of tutorials and examples to include in each pathway, but I’m wondering what you would like to see. What would you like to be able to do with Trove data?
You might get some inspiration by browsing through what’s already in the Trove Data Guide and the GLAM Workbench, or perhaps you have a research question that’s foundered because you couldn’t get the data you needed out of Trove. If you have any ideas please share them via the TDG’s ideas board. This is a chance to get some of your gnarly Trove data problems solved!
Note that the TDG links in this post go to the development version, which changes frequently. There is also a published version that doesn’t include the latest content.</p>

        <p>You probably know that when you select the Download as Image option for a digitised newspaper article in Trove what you get back is not actually an image ­– it’s an HTML document, in which the original image has been sliced up to try and fit on an A4 page when printed. So this article:

Ends up looking like this!!

So what do you do when you just want an image of an article as it appeared in the newspaper? Some years ago I figured out a workaround that involves scraping the OCR positional data that’s embedded in Trove’s newspaper viewer and cropping the article from a high-resolution image of the page. The method is documented in the GLAM Workbench and the Trove Data Guide, and I’ve packaged up the code in trove-newspapers-images so you can embed it in your own projects.
I also created a…</p>

        <p>What did the transformation from ‘socialism’ to ‘democracy’ and a market economy entail? When did it begin and did it ever end? The presentation proposes a new temporality of global transformation: It argues that its beginning dates in the mid 1970s, when socialist countries tried to enter the world market in shipbuilding. Of course, the end of state socialism and the subsequent global hegemony of neoliberalism after 1989/91 remain an important watershed, but the paper points to another important caesura, the enlargement of the European Union and of the WTO after the turn of the millennium. 
In the empirical part, the presentation will focus on our (the plural form here includes Ulf Brunnbauer in Regensburg, my longterm project partner and co-author of our forthcoming “multograph”) two cas…</p>

        <p>I spend a lot of my time trying to highlight the wealth of resources available through Trove – whether that’s 25,000 digitised Parliamentary Papers, 6,000 oral histories you can listen to online, or 3,471 full-page editorial cartoons from The Bulletin. Most recently I’ve been working on digitised periodicals, developing a new section for the Trove Data Guide. But as I was harvesting data about the 900 periodicals and 37,000 issues that had so far been digitised, I wondered about periodicals that were born digital – in particular, those that had been submitted to the National Library by publishers and authors through the National eDeposit Scheme (NED). It turns out, there’s a lot more than I realised.

ORTOLANG aims to construct a network infrastructure including a repository of language data (corpora, lexicons, dictionaries etc.) and readily-available, well-documented tools for its processing. You can learn more about ORTOLANG by visiting their website. 
CLARIN congratulates the centres and thanks all persons involved, in particular those responsible at the B-centre and the members of the assessment committee.

Open access in the sciences, a.k.a. Open Science, has become well established, especially so after the 2013 and 2022 Memoranda from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) reinforcing the idea that everyone, not just scholars at wealthy institutions, should have access to important and useful research, especially so when that research is paid for with public money.

Doctoral Student, Africana Studies



Marc Ridgell is a first-year PhD student in Africana Studies and William Fontaine Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. Their prospective dissertation uses critical ethnography and GIS mapping to examine how Black queer and trans people experience community amid active gentrification, policing, and larger neoliberal affects in Philadelphia. Their summer Price Lab project envisions a public-facing website that exhibits archives, oral histories, and maps of Black LGBTQ+ life and organizing in Philadelphia. 
 
They graduated magna cum laude with their B.A. from Washington University in St. Louis in May 2023. While at WashU, they completed a senior thesis through the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship, Schomburg-Mellon Humanities Summer Institute, and Leadership Alliance at the University of Chicago.

OSCARS cascading grants: deadline 15 May
As you might have seen at OSCARS 1st Open Call for Open Science Projects and Services or at EU Funding &amp; Tenders Portal there is an interesting opportunity to submit proposals via the OSCARS project. There is a significant budget (13 mio EUR) and with a funding rate between 100k and 250k EUR this means that around 50 to 100 proposals can be funded.
We recently published some ideas about how to relate proposals to the CLARIN and SSHOC research infrastructures.
CLARIN technical open hour, Monday 8 April at 11:00 CEST
The next edition of the CLARIN technology open hour is planned for Monday 8 April at 11:00 CEST. You can join virtually and ask our developers and infrastructure specialists anything. The special topic of this open hour is CLARIN-DSpace version 7. Anyone is welcome to join!
Deadline Centre Assessment Round approaching
The deadline for the upcoming B-centre assessment round is 30 April 2024.
If you would like to participate in this 23rd round, please make sure to use:
The updated CoreTrustSeal 2023-2025 and AMT platform.
The latest version of the B-centre checklist (7.4). The difference with the previous version is the addition of two (optional) recommendations at the end of the document, on the use of the attribute checker and attribute aggregator.
New on the CLARIN forum
OSCARS open call: some ideas and hints
Repositories listed on CLARIN website

        <p>Suite aux travaux de la Commission spéciale pour l&#x27;étude des spoliations des biens juifs au Luxembourg pendant les années de guerre 1940-1945 (2001-2009), trois idées dominaient la compréhension de la dépossession des personnes considérées comme juives au Luxembourg pendant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale. La première, reprenant la phrase de Paul Cerf, était de penser qu’il n’y avait « point de Rothschild parmi les juifs luxembourgeois », autrement dit qu’il n’y avait pas de collection d’œuvres d’art parmi cette population. La deuxième était que les bénéficiaires de la dépossession furent les organisations allemandes et leurs soutiens. La troisième était que le montant global de la dépossession pouvait être évalué sur la base de la comptabilité du Chef der Zivilverwaltung, l’administration civile allemande. Par une approche microhistorique et l’étude de deux cas – celui des propriétaires d’œuvres d’art et celui des habitants d’un quartier de la ville d’Esch-sur-Alzette – la thèse remet en question ces idées et ouvre la voie à de nouveaux développements des Holocaust studies sur un territoire jusqu’ici peu étudié.

        <p>The Luxembourg steel industry and its main company, ARBED, have undergone a profound transformation since the mid-1970s. Triggered by the economic crisis of 1973, this was characterised by the modernisation and closure of plants, the specialisation of production, international expansion and a far-reaching reduction in the workforce, a process often summarised under the term deindustrialisation. Part of this corporate transformation was the acquisition of the former VEB Maxhütte Unterwellenborn in Thuringia in 1992 and its transformation into a modern and profitable steelworks, making around ninety per cent of the former workers redundant and leading to a delayed but similar process of deindustrialisation. The project examines the history of ARBED between 1973 and 2001, starting from this point of transformation in 1992, and analyses the preconditions and related developments of this takeover, as well as its implications and consequences for ARBED&#x27;s activities in Thuringia and in Luxembourg. Using a transnational economic history approach, the project aims to analyse the interconnections between processes of deindustrialisation in Western and post-socialist Europe.

        <p>The Trove Periodicals section of the GLAM Workbench has been updated! Some changes were necessary to make use of version 3 of the Trove API, but I’ve also taken the chance to reorganise things a bit – starting with the name. This section used to be called ‘Trove journals’, reflecting the naming of Trove’s ‘Journals’ zone. But zones have gone, and periodicals are now spread across multiple categories, so I thought a name change was necessary to better reflect the type of content being examined.
What periodicals have been digitised?
It’s surprising difficult to find out what periodicals have actually been digitised in Trove. There’s no straightforward list of titles as there is in the newspapers category. Over the years I’ve created a variety of lists and tools to try and overcome this. I’m …</p>

10th annual Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities is April 4-5



The 10th annual Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities is slated for April 4-5 in the Willa Cather Dining Complex at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.
This year’s forum, “From Exclusion to Inclusion: Creating Responsible and Equitable Information and AI Systems for Digital Cultural Heritage,” is sponsored by the Office of Research and Economic Development Grand Challenges Seed Grant and the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities. Registration is required, and all presentations and events are open to the public.
A variety of scholars from around the world will discuss what it would take to develop artificial intelligence systems that manage cultural heritage materials (texts, images, videos and data) while generating new ways to contextualize the information, ask new questions and appreciate different perspectives. A key issue to be addressed in the development of this technology is making sure we are fair and unbiased in how we collect, describe and use these materials, while also teaching scholars how to understand both the technology and the social aspects involved.
The CDRH has hosted this forum since 2006, highlighting the diverse intellectual activity of the digital humanities field and showcasing the work of early career scholars.
There is more information on the  Nebraska Forum on Digital Humanities website.</p>

        <p>Parmi les Italiens qui se sont installés au Luxembourg figurent de nombreux militants politiques. Si les communistes font l’objet d’études, de recherches et de publications, la présence, le rôle et les activités des anarchistes sont peu connus. Le propos de cette intervention est de donner les éléments pour une meilleure connaissance de cette présence des anarchistes au Luxembourg, en la replaçant dans le contexte de la circulation des anarchistes italiens pour qui, alors qu’ils sont souvent forcés à l’exil et expulsés des démocraties européennes, le Luxembourg, notamment la ville d’Esch-sur-Alzette, est un point de passage obligé sur les routes européennes.

        <p>Que partagent des grand-mères portugaises installées au Luxembourg, un podcast sur Pierre Werner, une bande dessinée sur l’Europe des communications, les intérieurs des immeubles des institutions européennes, ou encore un jeu d’énigme sur la vie de Robert Schuman ? Ce sont autant de façons d’aborder, écrire, analyser, transmettre de nouvelles visions de l’histoire européenne, appuyées sur des sources et formats originaux. Nous vous invitons à les découvrir au cours de ce Forum Z. Élargir l’histoire européenne à de nouveaux publics, raconter l’histoire européenne différemment, c’est aussi, à l’occasion du 20ème anniversaire de l’élargissement de 2004, penser celui-ci autrement, comme y invitera le second temps de cet évènement.

        <p>Obituary: Jon Arild Olsen 1965–2024

            
Written by colleagues at the National Library of Norway
  



      

It is with great sadness that we received the message that Jon Arild Olsen passed away on March 16, 2024, after long-term illness.
He was the coordinator of the Norwegian Language Bank at the National Library of Norway and involved in multiple international language technology research initiatives, among them CLARIN. Jon Arild was also the Norwegian national delegate to the CLARIN General Assembly for many years.
Jon Arild was a humanist at heart as a scholar of French philology. He earned his PhD in French literature studies at the University of Oslo in 2002, with a dissertation on the theory of the novel. He later worked in the research administration at the University of Oslo until he joined the National Library of Norway in 2009, where he became the head of the research department in 2011. He was in later years very inspired by the advances within digital humanities and language technology and he also published within these areas.
Jon Arild was a true European and believer in international cooperation, having lived in France for many years. He had friends everywhere and was surrounded by an aura of calmness, rationality and humour, which we will deeply miss.

He was the coordinator of the Norwegian Language Bank at the National Library of Norway and involved in multiple international language technology research initiatives, among them CLARIN. Jon Arild was also the Norwegian national delegate to the CLARIN General Assembly for many years.
Jon Arild was a humanist at heart as a scholar of French philology. He earned his PhD in French literature studies at the University of Oslo in 2002, with a dissertation on the theory of the novel. He later worked in the research administration at the University of Oslo until he joined the National Library of Norway in 2009, where he became the head of the research department in 2011. He was in later years very inspired by the advances within digital humanities and language technology and he also published within these areas.
Jon Arild was a true European and believer in international cooperation, having lived in France for many years. He had friends everywhere and was surrounded by an aura of calmness, rationality and humour, which we will deeply miss.

        <p>│By Olivia McDermott, Gale Ambassador at the University of Liverpool│ For a subject such as drama, primary sources are continuously overlooked. Much academic study preceding degree level tends to focus on the practical realm of theatre. Though it is an important aspect, this sometimes leads to contextual ideas being ignored.

          <h3>A new way to explore editorial cartoons from *The Bulletin*<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>About five years ago I created a collection of full-page editorial cartoons from The Bulletin, harvested from Trove. Through a process that might be politely described as ‘iterative’, I fiddled with an assortment of queries and methods until I had at least one cartoon from every issue published between 4 September 1886 and 17 September 1952 – 3,471 cartoons in total. The details of the collection and how I created it are available in the Trove periodicals section of the GLAM Workbench.
Last night, as I was tidying up a new release of the Trove periodicals repository, I had a thought – why not put all of the details of the cartoons in a little database and make it available using Datasette-Lite for easy exploration? So I did.
Try it now!

One of the coolest new features is that I’ve harvested the OCRd text from each page containing a cartoon and created a full-text index. This means you can find cartoons by searching for words in their captions! Other features include embedded thumbnail images and links to download high-resolution versions of each page image.
In creating the database, I realised there were a few problems with the original metadata (dodgy page numbers), so I’ve fixed that up as well. I’ve also moved the mega zip download of every image (over 60gb) from the unfortunately deceased CloudStor service to AWS.</p>

        <p>The conference aims to critically (re)assess the value(s) of the Digital for the field of Jewish Studies as it has been developed and discussed over the past ten years.
Including all phases of research and dissemination from collecting and exploring to constructing and communicating, we will discuss the benefits and pitfalls of the Digital in general and for the field of Jewish Studies in particular. This can be done both from a retrospective—what has worked well and which promises have and have not yet been fulfilled—and from a forward-looking perspective—highlighting directions that might be worth pursuing. In doing so, we take up the recent critical turn in DH and apply it to the field of Jewish Studies. The event includes a hands-on-hackathon.
The full program can be consulted here. 
The conference and Hackathon is generously supported by the European Association for Jewish Studies (EAJS) Conference Grant Programme in European Jewish Studies.
Please register by 31 March 2024 at: https://forms.gle/7RE5yNmdESQddofx7
Please note that registration for the conference and the hackathon will take place separately. Please indicate in the form for which event/days you would like to register for (you can also register for both). Please also note that we only have a limited number of places. Places will be allocated in the order in which registrations are received.

An International Symposium at the Price Lab for Digital Humanities, co-organized with the Section for Sociology of Literature, Uppsala University.
This symposium marks the rise in recent years of empirical reader studies: data-driven research into what, why, and how people read. The full emergence of this field has been a long time coming.  Literary scholars have never shown much interest in conducting empirical study of contemporary reading practices among ordinary, non-professional, non-academic people.  Janice Radway’s Reading the Romance (1984) is the glaring exception that proves the rule.  By far the most widely-cited study of amateur literary readers, Radway’s book has been more influential for its findings abou…</p>

        <p>What was the geography of newspaper texts&#x27; circulation in the nineteenth-century United States? Scholars understand that many of the texts—including news, fiction, poetry, information, and more—which circulated through the newspaper exchange system originated in urban publication centers on the east coast, such as New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and that circulation often followed postal routes, train lines, or (eventually) telegraph wires. But the more granular dynamics of circulation have proven much harder to trace within massive newspaper archives, particularly the movement of texts among smaller urban and rural areas.

        <p>History, heritage, and games: three steps taken on a journey through time. The talk will begin with an examination of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (PLC) historical past. It will then introduce a framework of multiple heritage discourses that shape the collective memory of the PLC in 21st-century Poland. The framework explains the diversity of mental models used for worldbuilding and narrative design in Polish heritage narratives. All this leads to a demonstration of how these elements manifest in PLC-based game settings.
Michał Mochocki (PhD in Literature, Dr. habil. in Culture Studies), serves as the Executive Editor of the European Historical Game Studies journal, and works as an Associate Professor at Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz, Poland. His primary research interest is historical role-playing games, which he examines from the angles of transmedia narratology and heritage studies. He worked as Lead Writer on the BEAST: False Prophet video game.

        <p>The C²DH is hosting the international conference &quot;Historical arguments and the Digital&quot; from 25 to 27 June on the university campus in Belval.
In 2016, Franco Morretti argued that “somehow digital humanities has managed to secure for itself this endless infancy, in which it is always a future promise.”1 In the years since, little has changed. Whilst there has been exponential growth in the number of resources, tools, and methodological discussions in the digital humanities, there remains limited contribution towards traditional historical narratives implementing these, increasing the apparent gap between DH and traditional history. Terminology in the digital humanities – networks, mapping, modelling – has long been used metaphorically to explore historical phenomenon; yet in digitalizing t…</p>

Course encourages students to grapple with AI’s implications



The world was collectively agog as Open AI recently unveiled its new artificial intelligence video tool, Sora. Users shared colorful 3D animations and pirate ships floating on mahogany waves of coffee. A few days later, Sora was old news and Groq, an AI language tool, claimed global headlines for lightning-fast capabilities that leave ChatGPT in the proverbial dust.
And in a University of Nebraska–Lincoln classroom, Adrian Wisnicki quickly tweaked plans to incorporate these developments into class discussions — something he does often. Using cutting-edge AI tools, literature and contemporary films and articles, Wisnicki encourages students to grapple with questions related to AI and technology in the course…</p>

        <p>In 2005 the Guinness Brewery at Park Royal, West London closed after seven decades of production. The author spent the last six months of the Brewery’s life working with a photographer to record in words and picture the site before closure. Subsequent research carried out over a twelve-year period revealed an incredibly rich story of corporate culture change, the transformation of work and the workplace as well as deindustrialisation. His research included working in archives in Dublin, Scotland and London as well as oral histories and an extensive range of visual methods. Drawing on material from his book based on the project, Voices of Guinness: An Oral History of the Park Royal Brewery, Oxford 2019, the author reflects on what that story tells us about work meaning, identity and organis…</p>

        <p>The GLAM Workbench has a brand new section aimed at helping you find and use government publications in Trove. Most of the GLAM Workbench’s existing sections focus on a particular resource format, or are related to one of Trove’s top-level categories. This didn’t quite work for government publications, as things like Parliamentary Papers are spread across multiple categories, and can encompass a variety of formats. So I thought a new section was the best way of bringing it all together.
At the moment the Trove Government section includes two notebooks and three pre-harvested datasets.
Harvest parliament press releases from Trove
Harvest details of Commonwealth Parliamentary Papers digitised in Trove
Digitised Parliamentary Papers in Trove
Press releases relating to refugees

        <p>Artificial intelligence, particularly in the form of large language models, has been at the forefront of news for several years. The majority of historians, when they express an opinion on the matter, seem mainly concerned about whether their students will be able to have essays composed by an electronic servant, and if so, to whom the obtained grade should be attributed. It is true that sometimes one looks at the finger pointing towards the star and not at the moon itself. Indeed, it seems that the impact is not so much of the invention, but of the accessibility of these devices that could be significant. The acquisition of historical data, its manipulation, as well as its interpretation are expected to take place within a workshop, with deeply renewed tools. The collapse of the cost of data acquisition and manipulation opens up multiple possibilities, among which are the potential for data-driven research, the manipulation of corpora of unprecedented size, and, paradoxically, a distancing from the text, the basic element of the historian&#x27;s diet since the origins of the discipline. We will explore these potentialities through a few examples.

        <p>Since the 1970s, deindustrialisation has fundamentally changed Luxembourg’s economy, shifting its focus from industry to services. Beyond these major structural changes, the restructuring of the steel industry has had important consequences at the local level, both for workers and for industrial towns. This research focuses on the impact of deindustrialisation in three industrial towns in Luxembourg, Esch, Dudelange and Pétange, and aims to explore local challenges and initiatives in response to the restructuring of the steel industry.
The closure of blast furnaces and rolling mills triggered intense debates in the town councils of Luxembourg&#x27;s steel towns, focusing on issues such as the town budget and overall viability. Industrial decline was seen as a potential &#x27;death blow&#x27; for the existence of the towns, leading various stakeholders, including workers, shop owners, trade unionists and politicians, to rally against the closure of the local blast furnace. A key area of interest in the research are the local strategies implemented to address the challenges of deindustrialisation and the decisions taken by the steel companies ARBED and MMR-A and the Tripartite Conference. Although the focus of the research is on the cities, the national and European levels are also taken into account, as local actions extended beyond city boundaries.

        <p>The exhibition Minett Stories tells the history of the industrial region in the south of Luxembourg. Instead of focusing on the mining and smelting technologies, large iron works and steel barons, the project team decided to present the everyday history of an industrial region, concentrating on the time span from the industrialization of the region in around 1870 to the steel crisis of the 1970s. The online exhibition embraced the concept of transmedia storytelling for the production of narratives and media: the team worked in collaboration with several artists, stage actors and designers to produce graphic novels, interactive videos and maps, radio plays and video essays. The presentation will cover several examples to highlight this approach, before reflecting on the project as part of t…</p>

        <p>This year the annual conference of the Australian Historical Association will include a digital history stream, sponsored by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), and convened by me!
The call for papers is available here or through the Conference website. The list of possible topics is deliberately broad and inclusive – if you’re using digital tools or methods in the organisation, analysis, and visualisation of historical data we’d love to hear from you. Proposals are due on 23 February and can be submitted through the Conference website.

We’re particularly keen for HDR and ECR scholars to be involved. To help meet registration and travel costs, the ARDC is funding up to four $1000 bursaries. More details are available here. Bursary applications close on 31 March.
There’s also likely to be a digital history workshop, as well as updates on the work of the HASS &amp; Indigenous Research Data Commons and ARDC Community Data Lab, including the Trove Data Guide.
Time is short! Get your proposals in now! Contact me at tim@timsherratt.au if you have any questions.</p>

This project seeks to ensure that all materials pertaining to slavery at the university is identify and transcribe the contents of the main record sets from this time including President Basil Manly’s diaries, President Landon Garland’s letterbooks, the Faculty Minutes, and the collection most commonly referred to as the “slave receipts.” Most important of all, however, was identifying as many of the enslaved individuals who labored on UA’s campus, or who were enslaved by faculty and college presidents, as possible and entering those names, and the records associated with them, in a database

La construction européenne est rythmée par l’égalité entre les hommes et les femmes, inscrite d’abord dans les Traité de Rome (1957) et devenue, avec le Traité de Maastricht (1992), une valeur fondamentale et une priorité de l’UE, car les discriminations perdure…</p>

        <p>CLARIN is Joining Horizon Europe OSCARS Project

            

  
  
            
  


      

 
The five ‘Science Clusters’, which in the past four years worked together on funded projects under the Horizon 2020 programme, have now embarked on a new project: Horizon Europe OSCARS. The ambitious project, which aims to foster the uptake of Open Science in Europe by developing long-term interdisciplinary FAIR data services and working practices, will take place over the next four years. 
Many world-class European research infrastructures (RIs) are organised into one of the five major Science Clusters (Humanities and Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Photon and Neutron Science, Astronomy, Nuclear and Particle Physics). In the past four years, the Science Clusters have worked towards making open data easily accessible to both researchers and the public, by promoting scientific data management for enabling Open Science.
As a result, the five Science Clusters are an integral part of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) initiative and will further contribute to its development and implementation process through their participation in OSCARS.
CLARIN is proud to be participating in OSCARS as part of the SSHOC cluster. CLARIN is one of three research infrastructures from the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) area to represent the Cluster, together with DARIAH ERIC and CESSDA. Our involvement ensures that the SSH community is included in the project’s developments.   
To maintain the high momentum achieved during the Horizon 2020 programme, OSCARS has been granted ~25M EUR funding in the framework of the European Commission Horizon Europe call HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-01, under grant agreement no. 101129751, and will be implemented in the next four years.
For more information, visit the OSCARS project page.

        <p>As you read these lines, the Amazons Rainforest keeps on burning. During the month of August 2018, the news spread fast over social media platforms. Hashtags such as #wildfires #AmazonFires #SaveTheAmazons made their trends for not more than seven days. Other trends rapidly covered #AmazonFires trends. Approximately one million hectares of high biodiversity forests have been burned so far since the #AmazonFires started. Almost 20% of the Amazon rainforest has been devastated. Reports from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) show that in the first seven months of 2019, the deforestation rate in the Brazilian Amazon increased by 278%. Experts estimate that it would take 200 years for those forests to regenerate.
The Amazon is the largest and most diverse Rainforest in the world.…</p>

        <p>What we call “technology” today involves intensely concentrated metabolic processes, ingesting and transforming energy and materials on a planetary scale. Techno-metabolism also concentrates and compresses time. Its temporalities include Earth&#x27;s deep past (fossil fuels, minerals) and its present (biological net primary production). The Anthropocene epoch – with humanity as a new geological force – now appears likely to consume, as well, the human future, potentially to the extinction of our species. Holding multiple temporal and spatial scales within our analytic frameworks has proven (unsurprisingly) difficult for STS and History of Technology. This talk offers ways of reconfiguring our conceptual and methodological tools to meet this urgent challenge.

        <p>Since July 2022 I’ve been generating weekly snapshots of the contents of the Trove newspaper corpus. Every Sunday a new version of the Trove Newspaper Data Dashboard is created, highlighting what’s changed over the previous week, and visualising trends since April 2022 (when I first started regular data harvests).

All of the past versions of the dashboard are preserved in GitHub, but there wasn’t an easy way to browse them, until now. If you want to find out what changed in any week since July 2022, you can now visit the Trove Data Dashboard Archive and select a date from the list!
I created the archive by pulling all the versions from GitHub and saving them as individual files. I’ve also added some code to the weekly process that should automatically archive the past week from now on – we’ll see if it works next Sunday…</p>

        <p>As well as tools and code, the GLAM Workbench includes a number of pre-harvested datasets for researchers to play with. But just including a link to a CSV file in GitHub or Zenodo isn’t very useful – it doesn’t help researchers understand what’s in the dataset, and why it might be useful. That’s why I’ve also started including links that open the CSV files in Datasette-Lite, enabling the contents to be searched, filtered, and faceted. Just look for the Explore in Datasette buttons!
Datasette is an excellent tool for sharing and exploring data. I’ve used it in a number of projects such as the GLAM Name Index Search and the Tasmanian Post Office Directories. Datasette-Lite is a version of Datasette that runs completely in the user’s web browser – no need for separate servers! All you do is p…</p>

        <p>The «long» 1960s in Western Europe saw a dynamic development of mass consumption, especially in the field of consumer electronics. Media artifacts, such as transistor radios, television sets, or cassette recorders all became significantly more common in Luxembourg, France, and Germany, influencing the composition of the media ensemble and opening up new ways for consumers to interact with media. In a concomitant development brought about by the new market conditions, companies producing such media artifacts – such as Braun or Telefunken – became increasingly interested in marketing, placing consumers and their desires at the center of their considerations in lieu of production.
Using internal company documents, advertisements and statistics as sources, this research traces how and at what scale producing companies used advertising and other marketing measures to popularize media artifacts in the «long» 1960s and how these efforts interrelated with the media ensemble. This project is part of Popkult60.

Rune Kyrkjebø 1968–2023

We are saddened to announce the sudden passing of Rune Kyrkjebø on December 22, 2023. He was the assistant national coordinator of CLARINO and a member of the CLARIN Center Assessment Committee and a member of the User Involvement Committee. Rune leaves behind his wife Tone Merete Bruvik (who is on the

Rune was a true humanistic scholar. He studied philology and got his PhD at the University of Bergen in 2001 with a text-critical analysis of Old Norse Kings’ sagas. He also studied theology and published a Norwegian psalm lexicon. In his work as researcher and later senior librarian, he was involved in very many Digital Humanities projects, such as the Wittgenstein Archives at Bergen, the Norwegian Language Collections, the lexicographical projects, and others. He published widely on mediaeval philology, transcription, OCR,

Rune became very engaged in CLARIN activities. With others, he gave CLARINO courses on language data management, produced a series of instructional videos on how to use CLARINO data and services, and kept the CLARINO Bergen Centre running. He was co-author of a chapter in the 2022 CLARIN book.
We will miss Rune not only because he was always interested, helpful and dedicated, but also because he did so with a smile and a genuine modesty and friendliness.

        <p>CLARIN and Libraries 2023: A Recap

            

  
  
            
    
In May 2022, the first CLARIN and Libraries took place in the Hague, Netherlands. The aim was to bring together the CLARIN community and national and academic libraries to present and discuss content delivery systems for researchers. The motivation for the workshop was the sense that various, mostly national, projects were disconnected from each other and also disconnected from research infrastructures such as CLARIN. The workshop resulted in a mailing list, blog post, keynote and a panel discussion at the 2022 CLARIN Annual Conference, two poster presentations, the CENL Dialogue Forum ‘National libraries as data’ and, finally, the plan to organise a second iteration of CLARIN and Libraries, to be hosted in Norway.

        <p>The understanding of heritage greatly depends on its broad functions and use. Depending on their roles in specialist knowledge domains and society at large, heritage objects are categorized as either material or immaterial; static or dynamic; historical or contemporary in nature. For example, in societal debates, heritage needs to be fluid, debatable, even contestable, while scientists of the past seek the robustness of historical sources in order to create a valid reconstruction of aspects of the past.
In this workshop, we are not going to make things easier. Approaching the matter from the domain of critical heritage theory, we find that heritage is best understood as an ongoing forging and recasting of relationships. These relations present themselves as connections between present and …</p>

        <p>The hardest part of developing tools and resources like the GLAM Workbench is getting information about them to the people who might benefit. The collapse of Twitter has only added to the difficulty, as has the reluctance of GLAM organisations to share new resources with their users. I’d rather spend my time making new tools, but what’s the point if no-one knows they exist?
Anyway, I thought I’d do a bit of a communications refresh for the new year. If you’re interested in GLAM Workbench and Trove Data Guide updates you can:
Keep an eye on the GLAM Workbench channel of my microblog (or add the feed to your RSS reader)
Follow the GLAM Workbench Facebook page for cross-posted updates from the RSS feed
Follow the GLAM Workbench LinkedIn page for cross-posted updates from the RSS feed
I’m also working on an email newsletter thing that’ll compile the updates at regular intervals.
For more social socials, as well as questions, requests and problems, you can always find me on Mastodon: @wragge@hcommons.social. My email address is not too hard to find, but, honestly, your chances of getting a reply are slim.
If you’ve got a bug report, or a suggestion for a new notebook or data source, feel free to create an issue on GitHub.
And, of course, everything I do is openly-licensed, so you are very welcome to modify and share! See the GLAM Workbench for other ways to get involved.</p>

        <p>The National Library of Australia holds over 55,000 hours of oral history and folklore recordings dating back to the 1950s. This collection is being made available online, and many recordings can now be listened to using Trove’s audio player.
However, the oral history collection is not easy to find in Trove. You need to go the ‘Music, Audio, &amp; Video’ category and check the ‘Sound/Interview, lecture, talk’ format facet. To limit results to oral histories that have been digitised, you can add “nla.obj” to your query and set the ‘Access’ facet to ‘Online’. But what’s actually in the oral history collection and what can you do with it?
To help researchers explore and analyse the NLA’s oral history collection, I’ve added some notebooks to the Music, sound, and oral histories section of the GLAM…</p>

          <h3>Mapping MARC Geographic Area codes to Wikidata<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>
        </a>
        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://updates.timsherratt.org/>Tim Sherratt</a> |

        <p>Trove uses codes from the MARC Geographic Areas list to identify locations in metadata records. I couldn’t find any mappings of these codes to other sources of geospatial information, so I fired up OpenRefine and reconciled the geographic area names against Wikidata. Once I’d linked as many as possible, I copied additional information from Wikidata, such as ISO country codes, GeoNames identifiers, and geographic coordinates.
I’ve saved the resulting dataset in two formats – as a flattened CSV file (handy for loading as a dataframe), and as a JSON file that uses the geographic area codes as keys (handy for looking up values). You can download the datasets from this GitHub repository.
I’ve also written the codes back into the Wikidata records, so you can now find them with a SPARQL query like this.
The columns in the CSV file are:
code – MARC geographic areas code (without any trailing dashes)
place – name of geographic area from the MARC list
wikidata_label – name of geographic area from Wikidata
wikidata_id – Wikidata identifier
coordinates – pair of decimal coordinates in the form latitude,longitude (multiple values are pipe | separated)
iso_country_code – ISO two letter country code (multiple values are pipe | separated)
iso_numeric_country_code – ISO numeric country code (multiple values are pipe | separated)
geonames_id – GeoNames identifier (multiple values are pipe | separated)
Note that some fields can contain multiple values. For example the area Mediterranean Region is linked to 22 countries, so there will be multiple values in the ISO code fields.

For an example of this dataset in use, see Which countries do the oral histories relate to? in the Trove Data Guide.</p>

        <p>In 2023 the National Archives of Australia digitised 416,602 files (down from 575,597 in 2022). This chart shows the number of files digitised per day in 2023.

These files were drawn from 1,423 different series, but the vast bulk (81%) were from 4 series of World War Two service records. (This media release includes some details about the funding of the WW2 digitisation.)
Here’s the top twenty series by number of items digitised in 2023.

        <p>I’ve been capturing weekly snapshots of the Trove newspaper corpus for the last couple of years. You can see the latest results in the Trove Newspaper Data Dashboard. Using this data I’ve compiled a quick summary of changes over the last year.
7,518,764  digitised newspaper articles were added to Trove in 2023. The total  number of articles increased from 236,530,127 to 244,048,891. The chart below shows how the number of articles varied across the year. You’ll notice that the rate of digitisation increased about the same  time the government announced new funding for Trove. Were more articles  digitised because of the funding, or were articles in the digitisation  pipeline held back until the funding was announced? Or both?

Although the &quot;mother road, the road of flight&quot; was replete with vigilantes, popular and academic narratives downplay the folks who blockaded state lines to instead celebrate the fortitude of refugees who, against all odds, put down roots. &quot;Countermapping Kicks on Route 66&quot; layers the historical boundaries of freedom and exclusion back into cultural representations of Route 66.</p>

Using data from the CLARIN-IS repository, Sigríður Ólafsdóttir and Auður Pálsdóttir, associate professors at the University of Iceland, have created and published a list of Icelandic academic words – the first of its kind in Iceland. The researchers first developed a new corpus, MÍNO, from which a word frequency list of Icelandic vocabulary was created. The texts from the corpus were obtained from two corpora already available in the CLARIN-IS repository, The Icelandic Gigaword Corpus and the Tagged Icelandic Corpus.
Starkaður Barkarson, the National Coordinator for CLARIN-IS, assisted the researchers in creating the new corpus and the frequency list. All the three products, the corpus, the frequency list and the word list, have been uploaded to the CLARIN-IS repository.

        <p>How did newly drawn state border lines after the First World War provoke the establishment and implementation of policies and practices of veteran welfare selection? Different understandings of veteran welfare by historical actors in the French-Luxembourgish-German-Belgian borderlands prompted unique selections of beneficiaries, which resulting in the composition of various (cross-border) mixed welfare systems. This contribution highlights the importance of thinking about bordering practices in tandem with the way time was experienced by veterans and within their environments. 
SOCIOBORD reframes the history of welfare and social care in modern Europe by restoring the contributions of local actors – primarily families and associations – to shaping welfare systems in three European borderlands: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions from the late 19th century to the 1990s. SOCIOBORD turns the attention to the co-construction of social assistance by public and private actors in three borderland contexts marked by social, cultural, economic, religious or ethnic diversity.

, all Spanish academic institutions have been added to the Service Provider Federation, allowing researchers to use password-protected CLARIN services with their own institutional account.
Marking clarin.eu as safe domain
Over the past months there have been issues with emails sent via the CLARIN mailman mailing lists (lists.clarin.eu) not arriving for those using a mail server hosted in the Microsoft 365 cloud. We warmly recommend anyone using outlook or exchange interested in emails from CLARIN (such as this one!) to add clarin.eu as a safe domain.

Website on Drupal 10 and editorial improvements
The CLARIN website has been updated to Drupal version 10. While this is mostly relevant to its editors, you might also notice a lot of editorial improvements – many pages are being rewritten and restructured. If you spot anything that can be improved, please report it via the Website Feedback form that you can find in the footer of each page.

I applied for the CLARIN Mobility Grant to enhance some aspects related to my doctoral project, which focuses on the study of the Pellestrina dialect and the development of digital tools for linguistic analysis. Thanks to the financial support from CLARIN, from 6 to 12 November, 2023, I was able to visit the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa (FCSH), and connect with some of the most qualified European scholars in the field of Digital Humanities and computational linguistics.
The aim of this stay was to expand my knowledge in the use of advanced digital tools for lexical analysis and the development of domain ontologies. Indeed, these are cruc…</p>

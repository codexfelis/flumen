        <p>Last year I started compiling information about the level of Zotero integration provided by Australian GLAM organisations though their online collections. The basic test is, can Zotero capture useful, structured information about an item from the collection interface. The results are not great.
Zotero extracts information from a web site using a variety of &#x27;translators&#x27;. Some of these translators look for generic information embedded in a web page, such as  and  tags. Others are written to work with widely-used software systems, such as library catalogues. For bespoke systems, custom translators can be created to extract the necessary data. But sometimes, the data just isn&#x27;t available in a form Zotero can access.
custom translator for it many years ago. There&#x27;s also a custom translator for Trove&#x27;s digitised newspapers, but the translator for other parts of Trove was broken by the site&#x27;s upgrade in 2020. 
  
Dublin Core metadata in web pages, and Australian government agencies were expected to make use of AGLS to aid web discovery. But it seems these are no longer priorities.
  
The good news is we can fix this, either by supporting and encouraging GLAM organisations to embed useful metadata, or by creating custom translators. There&#x27;s been a lot of talk about HASS research infrastructure over the last six months, and it seems to me that some integration and cooperation in this area would make a big difference to the way researchers work with GLAM collections.

        <p>The China Biographical Database (CBDB) is the largest prosopographical database for the study of Chinese history. We use regular expressions and neural network models to systematically harvest data from primary and secondary sources and employ an entity-relationship model to organize our data. As a relational database with both online and offline versions, CBDB provides freely accessible, structured data for macroscopic, quantitative studies of premodern China. The data in CBDB is continuously disambiguated and readily formatted for statistical, social network, and spatial analyses, and also has value for tagging named entities in historical texts and contextualizing other data collections.

        <p>I regularly update the Python packages used in the different sections of the GLAM Workbench; though probably not as often as I should. Part of the problem is that once I&#x27;ve updated the packages, I have to run all the notebooks to make sure I haven&#x27;t inadvertently broken something -- and this takes time. And in those cases where the notebooks need an API key to run, I have to copy and paste the key in at the appropriate spots, then remember to delete them afterwords. They&#x27;re little niggles, but they add up, particularly as the GLAM Workbench itself expands.
I&#x27;ve been looking around at Jupyter notebook automated testing options for a while. There&#x27;s nbmake, testbook, and nbval, as well as custom solutions involving things like papermill and nbconvert. After much wavering, I finally decided to…</p>

        <p>Introduction: In this post, we highlight a new publication venue for Historian Digital Humanists, the Journal of Digital History where digital scholarship is presented in three layers: narrative, epistemic and data layers. These publications are therefore complex digital scholarly outputs that open a bigger window on DH research and enable readers to follow along the whole research process, execute or eventually even reproduce certain steps. We showcase this innovative publication method though highlighting a methodology paper from the first issue, Sarah Oberbichler’s and Eva Pfanzelter’s Topic-specific corpus building: A step towards a representative newspaper corpus on the topic of return migration using text mining methods.

        <p>We present a new dataset for the task of toponym resolution in digitized historical newspapers in English. It consists of 343 annotated articles from newspapers based in four different locations in England (Manchester, Ashton-under-Lyne, Poole and Dorchester), published between 1780 and 1870. The articles have been manually annotated with mentions of places, which are linked—whenever possible—to their corresponding entry on Wikipedia. The dataset consists of 3,364 annotated toponyms, of which 2,784 have been provided with a link to Wikipedia. The dataset is published in the British Library shared research repository, and is especially of interest to researchers working on improving semantic access to historical newspaper content.

Who We Are
The project is a collaboration of a large, international group of scholars who met in Oxford in 2016 at a CLARIN-funded workshop. We are a group of experts interested in speech data with very different backgrounds – oral history, computational linguistics, anthropology, sociolinguistics, phonetics and phonology. We also share an interest in exploring how technology can be integrated into research that involves spoken narratives.
oral history portal was created.

        <p>Dear CHR community,
We, together with CLS INFRA team, seek for your help and want to invite you to participate in the quick survey to map the current landscape and future directions in teaching computational literary studies!
CLS INFRA project aims to  create unified and easy access to a wide range of European and national infrastructures for the Computational Literary Studies community. This includes: connecting the resources and establishing standardized access to them, providing training environments and consolidating research networks, promoting the theoretical considerations for computational work on literature.
With this survey, CLS INFRA is looking for your help to find out which areas of research you would like to see represented in learning the computational and research skills necessary for data-driven studies of literature. Everyone with interest in the subject is invited to partake in the survey, regardless of experience level. The survey takes about 10-15 minutes to complete and you will help us shape the future of computational literary studies! 
The results of this survey will be used to supplement the current offer in training and schooling: CLS INFRA is organizing a series of Training Schools in the directions outlined by the research community.
Take me to the survey.
Thanks in advance for your time – and for forwarding the survey to those who might be interested!
Best wishes on behalf of the CLS INFRA project team,

          <h3>From Static to Interactive Maps: Drawing Diachronic Maps of (Latin) Modality with Pygmalion<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>
        </a>
        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/articles/>Journal of Open Humanities Data Latest Articles</a> |
          Reading time: 25 minutes </p>
        <p>In this paper, we present the diachronic maps of a selection of 75 Latin modal markers designed through the tool Pygmalion. Both the maps and Pygmalion were conceived in the framework of the WoPoss project, which aims at analysing the diachronic pathways of modality in Latin. While the description of the tool and its functionalities is beyond the scope of this paper, we focus here on the description of our diachronic modal maps.
Using visualisations to represent semantic shifts is a well-known practice in some linguistic fields such as typology and lexicography, and they have already been applied to modality. Though the situation is rapidly evolving, typological semantic maps as well as lexicographic maps are still for the most part static and usually not-interactive visualisations. Our modal maps stand out not only for their interactivity, but also for the richness of the information conveyed: chronology, etymology, semantics, syntax, first attestation and diachronic relationships between the meanings.
After presenting our conceptual framework for modality, we illustrate the process of conceptualisation and development of our diachronic maps of modality. More specifically, we explain how we gathered and organised the data in order to transpose it into a visual representation. We then showcase the map of possum as an example of our results. Subsequently, we discuss the results with respect to previous literature concerning both visualisation of modal evolution from a general point of view and the investigation of modality in Latin. Finally, we outline possible applications within and beyond the WoPoss project.

        <p>Tour de CLARIN: SADiLaR and the International Year of Indigenous Languages 2019 

            
 
Written by Liané van den Bergh
UNESCO declared 2019 the International Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL2019), which offered an international platform for promoting all indigenous languages, based on five key elements:
Increasing understanding, reconciliation and international cooperation
Creation of favourable conditions for knowledge-sharing and dissemination of good practices with regard to indigenous languages
Integration of indigenous languages into a standard setting
Empowerment through capacity building and
Growth and development through elaboration of new knowledge. 
The above-mentioned elements fall right within SADiLaR’s mandate to serve South Africa as a research infrastructure to en…</p>

        <p>Tour de CLARIN: Setswana Test Suite and Treebank

            
 
Written by Liané van den Bergh and Ansu Berg
The Setswana Test Suite and Treebank resource was developed as part of the PhD study of Ansu Berg, who performed a rule-based computational syntactic analysis of Setswana with a specific focus on simple sentences in the Setswana language. In order to develop a parser for Setswana, Ansu employed Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) to frame the description of Setswana grammar. LFG is a non-derivational, constraint-based theory of grammar that distinguishes between two levels of syntactic analysis of a natural language utterance; namely, a constituent and a functional structure. Figure 1 shows the LFG constituent structure for the Setswana simple sentence mosadi ga a ketla a reka ditlhak…</p>

The South African Centre for Digital Language Resources (SADiLaR) forms part of the South African Research Infrastructure Roadmap (SARIR) programme of the South African government’s Department of Science and Innovation (DSI). SADiLaR joined CLARIN as an observer in 2018 and is the only digital language research centre outside Europe which forms part of the European CLARIN research network as a C-Centre (a metadata providing centre). Current efforts are directed towards SADiLaR becoming a B-Centre (a service providing centre) in the near future.

        <p>The increasing ubiquity of machine learning algorithms in our everyday lives has prompted much critical debate over their ethical and epistemological implications. Much of this debate has focused on the kinds of social biases they encode and the need for humans to correct or intervene in their automated decisions. Humanistic disciplines naturally have much to offer these debates, with their long tradition of attending to the partiality of any claims to generalizable truth. But this critical stance can at times hinder recognition of machine learning as itself mired in a long history of debate over how to reason about error, bias, and the uncertainty of all knowledge. What might humanistic inquiry gain not by thinking around these ideas, as if they were problems belonging to the machine or a…</p>

Since joining CLARIN as an observer, a number of activities have been organised to help French researchers understand what CLARIN can do for them. On 16 November 2018, the CA2LI research team of the CLARIN-FR member &#x27;Laboratoire de Recherche sur le Langage&#x27; hosted a study day entitled ‘Lier recherche et formation professionnelle: des corpus à l&#x27;interface’ (Corpora at the Interface between Research and Vocational Training) at the Maison des Sciences de l’Homme, Université Clermont Auvergne (France). The main goal was to bring together researchers, trainers, and practitioners in the fields of language sciences, education, and healthcare to discuss ways in which multi-modal research corpora can be exploited from a pedagogical perspective for vocation…</p>

        <p>The Corpus of the Epigraphy of the Italian Peninsula in the 1st Millennium BCE (CEIPoM) is a linguistic database which covers the Oscan, Umbrian, Old Sabellic, Messapic and Venetic languages, as well as epigraphic Latin up to 100 BCE. The database is hosted on GitHub and Zenodo, and provides manually annotated linguistic information on all levels of language structure, ranging from phonology to syntax. In providing a high-resolution digital dataset for language varieties that have until now been largely restricted to printed reference works, this corpus opens up new avenues for research into this unique ancient linguistic area.

        <p>These are the first normalized, peer-reviewed, and morphologically enriched datasets to be published based on the reconstructions of Marcion’s Gospel by Matthias Klinghardt and Andrea Nicolotti. Two files were generated for each reconstruction: the first consisting of human-readable Postclassical Greek; the second of lemmatized and morphologically tagged text following the openly licensed BibleWorks Greek Morphology schema. Among several recent critical reconstructions of Marcion’s Gospel, those of Klinghardt and Nicolotti stand out as ambitiously maximalist and fully continuous, with considerably higher word counts than found in other recent reconstructions. These are the fourth and final batch in a series of normalized and enriched Greek datasets of major reconstructions of Marcion’s Gospel published by JOHD.

        <p>These four datasets are the first born-digital, normalized, lexicographically enriched, and peer-reviewed versions of the reconstructions of Marcion’s Gospel made by August Hahn in 1832 and Theodor Zahn in 1892. Two dataset files were generated for each reconstruction: the first consisting of human-readable Postclassical Greek; the second of lemmatized and morphologically tagged text following the openly licensed BibleWorks Greek Morphology schema. These datasets represent another batch in a series of normalized and enriched datasets of major reconstructions of Marcion’s Gospel published by JOHD.

Neither team has gotten off to a great start to their current campaign -- both teams are currently positioned on the periphery of the crowded playoff picture in the Eastern Conference. Absences and injuries have played a part in both teams&#x27; slow starts, but both will be looking to bounce back over the remainder of the season, and a big win on Christmas would represent a solid start.

        <p>This paper presents a full procedure for the development of a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagged corpus of Old Catalan. As an extremely low-resource language with rich inflection and frequent homographs, Old Catalan poses non-trivial problems in the development of a searchable constituency-based treebank. We demonstrate, however, that a semi- supervised method of incrementally building training data using both neural and memory-based taggers, together with the Pyrrha annotation tool is highly efficient and yields accurate results. We propose that this simple and effective method could easily be extended to other low-resource historical languages for which no NLP tools exist yet.

The CLARIN Café Towards Guidelines for Integrating CLARIN into Teaching - Lessons Learnt from UPSKILLS took place on 1 December 2021 and was organised and hosted by Iulianna van der Lek and Darja Fišer. About twenty-five lecturers, teachers and researchers from Europe, Thailand and the UK attended the café. 
 
The café continued the discussions from the CLARIN@Universities workshop on the role of the humanities infrastructures in training and education. The main aim was to share the first results from the UPSKILLS project and discuss the type of support and guidelines teachers and trainers need when using the CLARIN infrastructure in order to teach data management, data collection, processing…</p>

   has started a campaign to encourage the use of data citation in linguistic research papers. CLARIN supports this initiative wholeheartedly that complements the work done in the SSHOC project on data-citation in the SSH and the analysis of citation facilities offered by the CLARIN centres. CLARIN will investigate how data citation can be further improved from the side of CLARIN centres.

        <p>The international DH conference has played an eminent role not only in providing a forum for the presentation of completed research results, but also in creating a forum for the exchange of knowledge and research collaboration in the nascent stage of research, and it was therefore judged to be as desirable as possible to hold the meeting face-to-face, even if it involves some difficulties.
However, due to the continuous emergence of new variants, COVID-19 shows no signs of ending, and countries around the world are faced with intermittent and severe restrictions in various aspects, including medical care, education, research, and freedom of travel and movement. In the midst of this fluid situation, it is impossible to choose the hybrid meeting as it was envisioned.
In light of this situation, the LOs decided to change the DH2022 to be held entirely online, giving priority to providing equal and safe opportunities for all those who wish to participate. By providing a safe, respectful, and principled environment online for participants from around the world, regardless of the differences in their circumstances, we hope to contribute to the realization of ADHO&#x27;s principles.
The details of the online meeting plan will be expanded from the online meeting portion of the current plan to the full plan. We will do our best to accommodate ADHO members from all over the world in the program and other aspects of the conference.

Please introduce yourself – your academic background and current position.
I am a sociologist. I did my PhD at the University of Warsaw in the Institute of Applied Social Sciences. The topic of my thesis was occupational prestige from an individual perspective, and I was interested in how people with highly prestigious positions on the labour market feel their prestige and how it affects their professional and private biographies.

        <p>CLARIN Highlights of 2021

            
2021 – what a year it has been! 
The pandemic continues to make real-life interaction difficult, yet we have successfully connected virtually through various workshops, CLARIN Cafés, and – of course – the Annual Conference (CLARIN2021). Our community has grown thanks to one new member and several new K-centres. 
On this year’s holiday card, we proudly present the CLARIN highlights of 2021. Enjoy the card and browse through the links on the different items. 
Next year, CLARIN celebrates its 10th anniversary, and we are excited to see what 2022 will bring.

Unfortunately, with the ongoing limitations due to the pandemic which is dominating so many aspects of our lives, we will have to be a bit more patient and wait for the situation to improve, hopefully later in 2022. So, if you are keen to take part in the celebrations, please make sure to check the CL…</p>

From my vantage point as a small part of these committees, I hope you found them as helpful, creative, and passionate as I did.

        <p>Call for participation: Conference series &quot;The Art Museum in the Digital Age&quot; (January 17–21, 2022)



The Belvedere Research Center is continuing its conference series &quot;The Art Museum in the Digital Age&quot; (January 17–21, 2022) on the digital transformation of art museums with its fourth event on the topic. During the COVID-19-lockdowns, the digital presence of museums was no longer merely one possible extension of exhibition spaces, but rather the only way to reach the public. While our conference in 2021 focused on the crisis-related (re)turn to one’s own collections, this time it shifts to questions beyond binary concepts, such as media specificity, hybridity, and mixed reality. In five thematic blocks, the lectures deal with how the digital and the analog can be productively, conceptually, and aesthetically interwoven in a museum setting. We are delighted that Max Hollein, the director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, is our keynote speaker.

        <p>Data visualization is very often viewed as an equivalent of statistical representation of data in all its forms. This representation serves effectively certain objectives such as abstraction, reduction, standardization, or legibility, of interest to some disciplines and use cases, namely business, engineering, and science. Numerous tools and programming languages allow to visualize data according to these principles. Other disciplines and areas of knowledge, such as history, literature, art, journalism, or education, are confronted with the need to use the same tools ignoring some fundamental principles of their own disciplines, to program from scratch new visual vocabularies and functionalities, or to use design tools that are disconnected from the data.
As part of my research, I study the needs of the different disciplines and areas of knowledge, based on their own definitions of data and data visualization, the relationship between the two of them, and the user interaction; but I also experiment with transforming the visualizations from one paradigm to another, so that they can be used in interdisciplinary projects, or to open new approaches to data visualization within the disciplines themselves. During this presentation of my early research, I will present the initial description of the paradigms with a visual gallery of examples. And the first ideas of transformation of the visualizations between paradigms.

        <p>One of the things I really like about Jupyter is the fact that I can share notebooks in a variety of different formats. Tools like QueryPic can run as simple web apps using Voila, static versions of notebooks can be viewed using NBViewer, and live versions can be spun up as required on Binder. It’s also possible to export notebooks at PDFs, slideshows, or just plain-old HTML pages. Just recently I realised I could export notebooks to HTML using the same template I use for Voila. This gives me another way of sharing – static web pages delivered via the main GLAM Workbench site.
Here’s a couple of examples:
Papers Past newspapers in DigitalNZ – showing which Papers Past newspapers are available through DigitalNZ
Trove newspapers – number of issues per day, 1803–2020 – the number of newspaper issues published every day in Trove

Both are HTML pages that embed visualisations created using Altair. The visualisations are rendered using javascript, and even though the notebook isn’t running in a live computing environment, there’s some basic interactivity built-in – for example, you can hover for more details, and click on the DigitalNZ chart to search for articles from a newspaper. More to come! #dhhacks</p>

        <p>The video of my key story presentation at ResBaz Queensland (simulcast via ResBaz Sydney) is now available on Vimeo. In it, I explore some of the possibilities of GLAM data by retracing my own journey through WWI service records, The Real Face of White Australia, #redactionart, and Trove – ending up at the GLAM Workbench, which brings together a lot of my tools and resources in a form that anyone can use. The slides are also available, and there’s an archived version of everything in Zenodo.

This and many other presentations about the GLAM Workbench are listed here. It seems I’ve given at least 11 talks and workshops this year! #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Do you remember your last in-person conference? I do. I fondly remember reconnecting with familiar faces and learning alongside people brought together by shared interests. Yet some of the memories aren’t so warm: uncomfortable shoes, the buffet littered with dietary no-nos, some especially cringeworthy circus-themed post-lunch entertainment, and even connectivity problems when I misplaced my adapter! 
But I also remember my first online conference, the Creative Commons Global Summit in November, 2020. As a conference volunteer, I remember how we scrambled to figure out what was possible: Recording? Networking? Translation?  Dance party? It was a formative and transformative experience. And as transformative as it was for me, it was no doubt even more transformative for people who rarely had access to in-person conferences.
Now, with over a year of online conferences to learn from, it’s clear the innovations of online conferencing have set guideposts for the future of scholarly communication. Over the past nine months, the FORCE 2021 Organizing Committee  has worked tirelessly to create a conference that draws on the best of what we’ve all learned about global online events. Under the leadership of Osman Aldirdiri, we’ve crafted an event that aspires to be as welcoming as possible to scholarly innovators and communicators from all disciplines, geographies, communities, and career stages.
We hope you will join us December 7-9 at FORCE2021: Joining Forces to Advance the Future of Research Communications for an event centering exchange and open discussion. We are members of all of the communities that make up FORCE11--scholars, librarians, archivists, publishers, research funders, and more, broadly and inclusively defined. If you care about the future of research communications and the technologies that are enabling new possibilities, learn more about the conference and REGISTER.

        <p>We’re happy to announce the release of the first ‘MacBERTh’ model!
We’d like to use this forum to allow people to approach us with any questions. Ask away, and @enrique.manjavacas and @l.fonteyn will try to help you as much as we can.
More information on the project can be found on our website:
https://macberth.netlify.app/
MacBERTh is the cover term for a suite of language models (more specifically, BERT models) pre-trained on historical textual material (date range: 1450-1950).
Researchers who interpret and analyse historical textual material are well-aware that languages are subject to change over time, and that the way in which concepts and discourses of class, gender, norms and prestige function in different time periods. As such, it is quite important that the interpretation of textual/linguistic material from the past is not approached from a present-day point-of-view, which is why NLP models pre-trained on present-day language data are less than ideal candidates for the job. That’s where MacBERTh can help.
At present, a model pre-trained on historical English (1450-1950) has been published in the huggingface repository. The release of a Dutch historical model is planned for 2022.
For publications and talks related to the project, as well as information on how to cite us, please check our website. If you end up using our model for you research, we would love to highlight and refer others to your work on our website as well, so please do not hesitate to contact us to share your work.

        <p>The newly-updated DigitalNZ and Te Papa sections of the GLAM Workbench have been added to the list of available repositories in the Nectar Research Cloud’s GLAM Workbench Application. This means you can create your very own version of these repositories running in the Nectar Cloud, simply by choosing them from the app’s dropdown list. See the Using Nectar help page for more information.

I’ve also taken the opportunity to make use of the new container registry service developed by the ARDC as part of the ARCOS project. The app now pulls the GLAM Workbench Docker images from Quay.io via the container registry’s cache. This means that copies of the images are cached locally, speeding things up and saving on data transfers. Yay for integration!

Thanks again to Andy and the Nectar Cloud staff for their help! #dhhacks</p>

        <p>In preparation for my talk at ResBaz Aotearoa, I updated the DigitalNZ and Te Papa sections of the GLAM Workbench. Most of the changes are related to management, maintenance, and integration of the repositories. Things like:
Setting up GitHub actions to automatically generate Docker images when the repositories change, and to upload the images to the Quay.io container registry
Automatic generation of an index.ipynb file based on README.md to act as a front page within Jupyter Lab
Addition of a reclaim-manifest.jps file to allow for one-click installation of the repository in Reclaim Cloud
Additional documentation in README.md with instructions on how to run the repository via Binder, Reclaim Cloud, Nectar Research Cloud, and Docker Desktop.
Addition of a .zenodo.json metadata file so that new releases are preserved in Zenodo
Switch to using pip-tools for generating requirements.txt files, and the include unpinned requirements in requirements.in
Update of all Python packages
From the user’s point of view, the main benefit of these changes is the ability to run the repositories in a variety of different environments depending on your needs and skills. The Docker images, generated using repo2Docker, are used by Binder, Reclaim Cloud, Nectar, and Docker Desktop. Same image, multiple environments! See ‘Run these notebooks’ in the DigitalNZ and Te Papa sections of the GLAM Workbench for more information.

Of course, I’ve also re-run all of the notebooks to make sure everything works and to update any statistics, visualisations, and datasets. As a bonus, there’s a couple of new notebooks in the DigitalNZ repository:
QueryPic DigitalNZ – a web app to visualise searches in Papers Past over time (I’ll post some further info about this shortly)
Papers Past newspapers in DigitalNZ – displays details of the Papers Past newspapers available through DigitalNZ (you can view the results as an HTML page)

        <p>This position paper outlines curation as a distinct area of linguistics which supports the assessment of existing linguistic data sets. The starting point of the discussion lies in the work with legacy materials and necessary skills for reviewing them. The discussion of skills and knowledge relevant for this task lays out requirements for training and preparing academics and professionals for curation in ways that creates career options. Due to the importance of properly maintained data sets and the time-consuming nature of curation, this specialisation deserves the same merit as other areas of linguistics and should be treated equally.

          <h3>Whose Crisis? COVID-19 Explored through Arts and Cultural Practices of African Communities<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

          Reading time: 22 minutes </p>
        <p>The “Whose Crisis?” project is in response to a continually evolving global health pandemic, COVID-19. In this context, the dominant discourses have been generated in the Global North, overwhelmingly by a minority of wealthy and powerful authors, reflecting narrowly on a crisis that, while impacting the whole world, is experienced in vastly different ways. This article frames and contextualises data from this project through an introduction to the background, contexts, and methods of a project designed to reflect the lived experiences of, perspectives on, and responses to COVID-19 in vulnerable communities across sub-Saharan Africa. The project has been carried out by a large team of collaborators who prioritise the lived experiences, customs, and needs of the communities engaged through a culturally responsive and arts-based research approach. The article points to the methodological implications of arts-based research to explore plural perspectives in participatory ways, and the socio-political possibilities of amplifying the voices of under-represented and under-served communities in Africa, in terms of global health in a pandemic context.

        <p>Call for Papers: Digital Parliamentary Data in Action

            
The call for papers for the workshop ‘Digital Parliamentary Data in Action’ co-located with the 6th Digital Humanities in the Nordic and Baltic Countries Conference (DHNB 2022) is now open.
The accessibility of parliamentary data is a democratic issue and raises questions about how such datasets can be used to empower citizen participation and enhance the transparency of political work and decision making. Hence, curation and research of parliamentary records, as well as the development of new tools and user interfaces relevant for the parliamentary data are embedded in critical societal discussions, and bear consequences from both scholarly and citizen perspectives.
These developments have led to enhanced opportunities and challenges for research and development. The workshop therefore draws together scholars across different disciplines to explore and showcase results and ongoing work on creating, publishing, and using digital parliamentary data in digital humanities research and applications. The aim is to foster interaction between the scholars in the humanities, social sciences, and computational sciences.
Deadline for submitting the papers: 13 January 2022

        <p>Du milieu du 19e siècle aux années 1960, des dizaines de milliers d’ouvriers et d’ouvrières belges sont partis chaque année travailler dans le Nord de la France pour y profiter d’opportunités d’emploi plus avantageuses qu’en Belgique. Ils/elles travaillaient dans l’agriculture, l’industrie ou le secteur de la construction et réalisaient les travaux les plus pénibles et les moins bien rémunérés. Ces migrations ouvrières ont été tour à tour freinées ou encouragées, selon le contexte économique et les besoins de main d’œuvre dans le Nord de la France. Elles ont donné lieu à des tensions et des négociations entre les industriels, les syndicats, les associations qui défendaient les intérêts des migrants et les autorités publiques, de part et d’autre de la frontière.

        <p>Sous quelles conditions économiques et techniques la sidérurgie luxembourgeoise a-t-elle réalisé sa modernisation à partir du milieu du XIXe siècle ? Quelles ont été les spécificités de l’essor de l’exploitation minière du fer et de la production sidérurgique du Bassin Minier durant la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle ? Quelle a été la part des innovations techniques dans ce processus de développement ? Voilà quelques-uns des thèmes qui vont être abordés lors de cette communication qui présentera aussi le contexte de la fondation d’une grande entreprise sidérurgique luxembourgeoise en 1911, l’ARBED.

        <p>In the British referendum on 23 June 2016, the majority of the electorate (51.89%) voted for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, or “Brexit”. Based on the referendum result, the UK – which signed the Treaty of Accession to the European Economic Community on 22 January 1972, under the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council of the EEC – left the EU, at the end of a procedure governed by article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Initially scheduled for the end of March 2019, the withdrawal was postponed three times and only took effect on 31 January 2020, following a transitional period. The Withdrawal Agreement covers various issues including the protection of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British citizens living in EU countries, post-Brexit financial com…</p>

This paper, authored by Stephan Buddenbohm, Maaikew de Jong, Jean-Luc Minel  and Yoann Moranville showcase the demonstrator instance of the Data Deposit Recommendation Service (DDRS), an application built on top of the re3data database specifically for scholars working in the Humanities domain.

        <p>Each year we accept applications for two Communications Fellowships for students or early career scholars to work with me on communications projects. These fellowships are meant to extend from January through December. However, in late 2020 and early 2021 we developed a communications policy to better support the Communications Team. This work delayed the fellowship call for applications, reviews, and onboarding.
Our current fellows, Anna Sofia Lippolis and Erdal Ayan began their work with ADHO in June 2021. To ensure that they have the same opportunities as previous fellows who have worked with us most or all of a calendar year—such as completing a special communications project and participating in communications around the Digital Humanities conference—ADHO’s COB have voted to extend their fellowships through December 2022. Anna and Erdal have accepted their extensions, and we are looking forward to working with them over the next year.
This means that we will not be accepting Communications Fellowship applications for 2022. The next round of applications for 2023 will open in November 2022.

        <p>Tour de CLARIN: The CLARIN Knowledge Centre for South Slavic languages (CLASSLA)

            


Written by Nikola Ljubešić, Taja Kuzman, Tomaž Erjavec, and Petya Osenova
The CLARIN Knowledge Centre for South Slavic languages (CLASSLA) was recognized by CLARIN on 19 March 2019. The centre offers support for automated processing of South Slavic languages, and is operated by the Slovenian CLARIN.SI, and by the Bulgarian CLaDA-BG.
 
CLASSLA recognizes the need for the development of language resources and technologies not only for Slovene and Bulgarian, but also for the other under-resourced South Slavic languages. That is why the centre aims to support researchers from the fields of Computational and Corpus Linguistics, Digital Humanities, as well as interested individuals from other scienti…</p>

        <p>Building on the 2020 symposium, which dealt with public history and public participation in museums, this 2021 event focuses on the multiple and diverse narratives in participatory history. Reinforced by ideology, identity, memory, and personal stories, public participation can enrich history and foster a variety of perspectives that may compete or complement one another. Navigating diverse experiences and perceptions of the past raises the matter of diverse interpretations of historical narratives and their possible inclusion in historiography and museums. This plurality can affect historical narrations, especially within highly conflicting societies, where the perceptions of historical facts can be very diverse and sometimes even incompatible. Museums can be battlegrounds for political d…</p>

        <p>These two datasets are the first normalized, peer-reviewed, and lexicographically enriched transformations of Dieter Roth’s 2015 reconstruction of Marcion’s Gospel to be published. The first dataset consists of human-readable Postclassical Greek, while the second lemmatizes and morphologically tags the text according to the openly licensed BibleWorks Greek Morphology schema. Among several recent critical reconstructions of Marcion’s Gospel, Roth’s has gained the most acceptance among scholars. These datasets represent the second batch in a series of normalized and enriched datasets of major reconstructions of Marcion’s Gospel published by JOHD, Harnack’s public domain work being the basis of the first.

        <p>I’m hoping that the GLAM Workbench will encourage GLAM organisations and GLAM data nerds (like me) to create their own Jupyter notebooks. If they do, they can put a link to them in the list of GLAM Jupyter resources. But what if they want to add the notebooks to the GLAM Workbench itself?
To make this easier, I’ve been working on a template repository for the GLAM Workbench. It generates a new skeleton repository with all the files you need to develop and manage your own section of the GLAM Workbench. It uses GitHub’s built in templating feature, together with Cookiecutter , and this GitHub Action by Stefan Buck. Stefan has also written a very helpful blog post.
The new repository is configured to do various things automatically, such as generate and save Docker images, and integrate with Reclaim Cloud and Zenodo. Lurking inside the dev folder of each new repository, you’ll find some basic details on how to set up and manage your development environment.
This is just the first step. There’s more documentation to come, but you’re very welcome to try it out. And, of course, if you are interested in contributing to the development of the GLAM Workbench, let me know and I’ll help get you set up!</p>

Call for papers_Online Meeting &quot;Programming in Digital Humanities&quot;, University of Évora, Portugal



On behalf of the Organizing Committee of the online meeting &quot;Programming in Digital Humanities&quot;, 16-17th December, I am pleased to share relevant information about this upcoming event on:
https://sites.google.com/uevora.pt/programmingdhs
Programming in Digital Humanities (DH) is one of the most challenging topics in this field of knowledge and research. Unfortunately, a significant number of DH’ers coming from areas of knowledge such as literature, philology, history, etc., still experience great difficulties when it comes to use programming languages to handle their data and display it. This meeting aims to address these difficulties and discuss the latest developments associated to programming in DHs by bringing together scientists from different areas within the community.
For registration and submission of abstracts, please use the Indico platform, where you will be asked to create a user profile:

        <p>My team has been collecting full runs of psychology journals from around the turn of the 20th century and, using statistical methods, converting them into networks not of people, as is the typical practice, but of the articles themselves. This leaves us with the question of how to interpret clusters of articles that are associated with each other by the vocabularies they contain. In this talk, I will ask you to participate in our interpretive process and help to name the clusters yourselves (then we can see how your labels line up with the ones that we came up with). The journal we will be using is the American Journal of Psychology, from its founding by Granville Stanley Hall in 1887 up to 1902.
 
Christopher Green works in the Historical, Theoretical, &amp; Critical Studies of Psychology Program at York University in Toronto, Canada.

        <p>Introduction: Awarded as Best Long Paper at the 2019 NACCL (North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics) Conference, the contribution by Jacob Devlin et al. provides an illustration of “BERT: Pre-training of Deep Biredictional Transformers for Language Understanding” (https://aclanthology.org/N19-1423/).

As highlighted by the authors in the abstract, BERT is a “new language representation model” and, in the past few years, it has become widespread in various NLP applications; for example, a project exploiting it is CamemBERT (https://camembert-model.fr/), regarding French. 

In June 2021, a workshop organized by David Mimno, Melanie Walsh and Maria Antoniak (https://melaniewalsh.github.io/BERT-for-Humanists/workshop/) pointed out how to use BERT in projects related to digital humanities, in order to deal with word similarity and classification classification while relying on Phyton-based HuggingFace transformers library. (https://melaniewalsh.github.io/BERT-for-Humanists/tutorials/ ). A further advantage of this training resource is that it has been written with sensitivity towards the target audience in mind:  in a way that it provides a gentle introduction to complexities of language models to scholars with education and background other than Computer Science.


Along with the Tutorials, the same blog includes Introductions about BERT in general and in its specific usage in a Google Colab notebook, as well as a constantly-updated bibliography and a glossary of the main terms (&#x27;attention&#x27;, &#x27;Fine-Tune&#x27;, &#x27;GPU&#x27;, &#x27;Label&#x27;, &#x27;Task&#x27;, &#x27;Transformers&#x27;, &#x27;Token&#x27;, &#x27;Type&#x27;, &#x27;Vector&#x27;).</p>

        <p>The past year, fraught with so many challenges for our international community, has been one of building and rebuilding for ADHO. While we met virtually and largely asynchronously for DH2020 instead of gathering as we had so carefully planned in Ottawa, we have greatly missed the sharing of scholarship and fellowship that a 2021 DH conference would have brought. However, we acknowledged early in the year that health and safety restrictions would have made an international DH conference impossible in 2021. Instead, we are supporting regional conferences hosted by our Constituent Organizations and are looking forward to the meeting the Program Committee and our colleagues in Tokyo are planning for DH2022.

        <p>From 4am on Monday 22 November, the government will recognise vaccines on the World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL). As a result, Sinovac, Sinopharm Beijing and Covaxin will be added to our list of approved vaccines for inbound travel, benefitting more fully vaccinated people from countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and India. The US also recognises the vaccines on the WHO EUL for inbound travel.
Passengers who have been fully vaccinated and have received their vaccine certificate from one of over 135 approved countries and territories are not required to take a pre-departure test, day 8 test or self-isolate upon arrival. Instead, passengers will just need to pay for a lateral flow test to take before the end of their second day, post-arrival.

        <p>The man who died shortly after being arrested by Winnipeg Police last week has been identified by family as George Simeonidis Jr, who owned Santa Lucia Pizza on Corydon Ave. (Submitted by Jessica Simeonidis)
The man who died shortly after being arrested by Winnipeg Police last week has been identified by family as George Simeonidis Jr., a Winnipeg restaurant owner.
A family member who did not want to be interviewed said Simeonidis Jr. owned the Santa Lucia Pizza on Corydon Ave.
Manitoba&#x27;s police watchdog has launched an investigation into the death after Simeonidis collapsed after being arrested on Thursday in Winnipeg. 
The death happened after police were called about a man walking on the road and acting aggressively on Osborne Street, says a news release from the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba, which investigates serious incidents involving police. 
Police arrived around 7:17 p.m. and put the man in handcuffs, after which he collapsed, the release says. 
Paramedics were already present and administered CPR. Simeonidis was rushed to St. Boniface Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
The Independent Investigation Unit asks anyone with information about this incident to call them at 1-844-667-6060. 
No further details were provided.
A service will be held for the 44-year-old father of two on Wednesday.</p>

        <p>The PapyGreek Treebanks dataset contains documentary texts written in Postclassical Greek (ca. 300 BCE–700 CE), morphosyntactically annotated according to Dependency Grammar. The source of the texts is the Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri (DDbDP), which preserves the modern editorial treatment of the documents in TEI Epidoc XML encoding. Aiming to expose linguistic variation in the DDbDP, we have annotated two versions of a selection of documents: the plain transcription and an editorially corrected version. The dataset also comprises metadata about the documents’ dating and provenance, text type, and the persons involved. Furthermore, it facilitates linguistic research on these texts.

        <p>Previously on ‘What could we do with $2.3 million?’, the National Library of Australia produced a draft plan for an ‘Advanced Researcher Platform’ that was thoroughly inadequate. Rather than submit this plan to the ARDC for consideration as part of the HASS RDC process, the NLA wisely decided to make some fundamental changes. The redrafted draft is now available for re-feedback. This is where we pick up the story…
So what has changed?
Generally speaking there seem to be two major changes.
There’s a much greater focus on consultation and collaboration.
There’s less detail about what will actually be developed.
These two changes can work together positively. The details of what’s being developed can be worked out through consultation, ensuring that what’s developed meets real research needs.…</p>

Title: Uncertainty and Underspecification in Humanities Applications of Natural Language Processing
Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) and other applications of machine learning are playing an increasingly large role in the humanities and social sciences. These technologies make it possible to automate labeling tasks that would otherwise be too time-consuming or tedious to perform by hand. However, NLP systems do not achieve perfect accuracy. More concerning, their errors are not uniformly distributed, but rather, can encode and propagate bias from the training data. In this talk, I will survey the validity threats that arise from various types of learning-based NLP systems, ranging from classical models like logistic regression to contemporary architectures that combine pretraining, fine-tuning, and domain adaptation. Of particular interest is the problem of underspecification, highlighted by D’Amour et al (2020): even when overall test set accuracy can be estimated with high precision, the performance on other metrics may vary dramatically with seemingly irrelevant details such as the seed value used to randomly initialize the model’s parameters. After this survey, I will describe our approach to validity in our work on Abolitionist Networks (Soni et al 2021), which combines topic models and network analysis. I will conclude by offering a set of recommendations for practitioners in the digital humanities.

Digital project expands access to Genoa Indian School history



Four years in, a University of Nebraska–Lincoln research project has been successful at uncovering, digitizing and annotating thousands of documents from the Genoa U.S. Indian Industrial School in Genoa, Nebraska, and plans are being made to grow the project further.
The Genoa Indian School Digital Reconciliation Project was founded to tell the stories of the American Indian families affected by the displacement of children to the Genoa school, often through force or coercion.
The Genoa school, which was run by the federal government from 1884 to 1934, was one of more than 300 similar schools throughout the United States — some run by the government, others run by churches. Researchers estimate that more t…</p>

        <p>Want a bit of added GLAM with your digital research skills? You’re in luck, as I’ll be speaking at not one, but three ResBaz events in November. If you haven’t heard of it before, ResBaz (Research Bazaar) is ‘a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy at the centre of modern research’.
On Wednesday, 24 November I’ll be giving a key story presentation (like a keynote, but with more story!) entitled Exploring GLAM data for ResBaz Queensland. This presentation will also be simulcast through ResBaz Sydney.
On Thursday, 25 November I’ll be giving a presentation on the GLAM Workbench for ResBaz Aotearoa – focusing in particular on NZ GLAM data.
The programs of all three ResBaz events are chock full of excellent opportunities to develop your digital skills, learn new research methods, and explore digital tools. If you’re an HDR student you should check out what’s on offer.</p>

        <p>An inquiry on Twitter prompted me to put together a notebook that you can use to download all available issues of a newspaper as PDFs. It was really just a matter of copying code from other tools and making a few modifications. The first step harvests a list of available issues for a particular newspaper from Trove. You can then download the PDFs of those issues, supplying an optional date range. Beware – this could consume a lot of disk space!
The PDF file names have the following structure:
[newspaper identifier]-[issue date as YYYYMMDD]-[issue identifier].pdf

For example:
903-19320528-1791051.pdf

903 – the Glen Innes Examiner
19320528 – 28 May 1932
1791051 – to view in Trove just add this to http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue, eg http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue1791051
I also took the opportunity to create a new Harvesting data heading in the Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Reading can be a solitary activity—an interior conversation between reader and author. Often this conversation unfolds as marginalia. While I typically read with a notebook next to me, much of my thoughts and reactions to what I read are overlayed directly on the text. An underlined phrase, a scribbled connection, a stray exclamation point reflecting the thrill of being surprised (amazing!) or feeling righteously indignant (how dare he!?!). While I’ve experimented with the highlighting and comment features offered by different pdf readers, these have never felt as satisfying as the closeness of scribbling my reflections alongside the text that prompted them. 

Earlier in October, I had the pleasure of having my private world of pen and paper marginalia broadened by the concept of social annotation. To learn more about the workshop and for an interview with the facilitator, Arun Jacob, keep reading.</p>

        <p>Nach dem Versailler Vertrag sahen sich die europäischen Nationalstaaten mit der Herausforderung konfrontiert, in ihren neuen Grenzgebieten, in denen sich die Mitbürger oft entlang religiöser, sprachlicher, kultureller oder ethnischer Grenzen drastisch voneinander unterschieden, nationale Loyalität zu vermitteln. Peripheries at the Centre vergleicht die Erfahrungen des Schulwesens in Oberschlesien in Polen und Eupen, Sankt Vith und Malmedy in Belgien - Grenzregionen, die nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg vom Deutschen Reich abgetrennt wurden. Es wird gezeigt, wie die neu konfigurierten Länder die Grenzlandschulen und das Erlernen von Sprachen als Instrumente zur Verwirklichung des imaginierten friedlichen Europas betrachteten, das die politische Geografie der Zwischenkriegszeit unterstrich.

          <h3>A Europeanisation of the Comics Industry: The Franco-Belgian School as a Foundation of a European Cultural Identity through Media in the 1960s<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

        <p>Comics are often used in research as a counter-narrative for an Americanisation of European societies in the second half of the 20th century. The Franco-Belgian bande dessinée school meanwhile appears as a symbol of a successful resistance against the American superheroes.
This presentation of my thesis research has two primary aims:
on the one hand to portray the history of Franco-Belgian comics diffusion in a (Western) European context,
but on the other hand to critically examine the hypothesis of Europeanisation in the 1960s.
While there is interest in the field of translation strategies that have been applied to central works of the Franco-Belgian school, there has been little attention paid to the editorial practices of the 1960s that facilitated this translation. Comics circulate across language barriers, and so allow insights into the relationship between different countries and cultures, the circulation of cultural goods inside and outside the production space, and the role of cultural mediators. Comics are also just one aspect of a transmedial and transnational space of the 1960s, factors that are most clearly indicated by comics magazines such as Journal de Tintin and Pilote, and these examples and their translations will form the main corpus of primary sources. This thesis will therefore consider the lens of publishing practice in order to shed a new light on these crucial aspects.

        <p>The GLAM Workbench isn’t dependent on one big piece of technological infrastructure. It’s basically a collection of Jupyter notebooks, and those notebooks can be used within a variety of different environments. This helps make the GLAM Workbench more sustainable – new components can be swapped in and out as required. It also makes it possible to create different pathways for users, depending on their digital skills, institutional support, and research needs. For example, links to Binder make it easy for users to explore the possibilities of the GLAM Workbench and accomplish quick tasks. But Binder has limits. Where do you go when your research project scales up?
Earlier this year I added one-click installation of GLAM Workbench repositories in Reclaim Cloud. Today I’m very pleased to annou…</p>

This ever-growing project seeks to transform the complexities of early Soviet journals’ graphic environments into useable data. The current iteration of the project’s corpus includes twenty-six distinct titles containing over a hundred thousand articles, poems, editorial commentaries, advertisements, theater listings as well as images representing a variety of genres and media. Through the abstraction of journal elements as data, we seek to produce representations that will make not only the journals’ contents but also big picture structures available to distant reading and analysis for researchers.
We ask: What can we ask of periodicals that we might not of other digitized media? What can machine learning tell us about these journals that might be overlooked in ordinary or habitual reading practices? What patterns can we discover across a collection? What types of images or subjects appear and disappear in the history of publication? Are there unexpected points of continuity or difference between a diverse set of journals published at the start of the twentieth century?
This Stanford-based extension of the project, begun at Princeton University and in collaboration with ITMO University in St. Petersburg, focuses particularly on the diverse images featured in the journals’ pages. Having begun with the articulation of rudimentary image typologies and applied computer learning to the image corpus (identifying illustrations, photographs, caricature, advertisements as well as subjects), we are currently looking for new ways to extract data related to color values and quantity across the journal runs.

Title: Getting a Whiff of the Past through the Analysis of Historical Documents
Abstract: Although olfactory references play a crucial role in our cultural memory, only few works have tried to understand how they are described in historical texts and process them from a computational perspective. As a first step towards olfactory information extraction, I will present ongoing work aimed at defining a theoretical framework to capture this information from a linguistic point of view. This framework has led to the development of a multilingual benchmark with annotated smell events, covering different time periods and domains. Based on this novel dataset, it is now possible to make cross-lingual comparisons, pointing out different attitudes and perceptions of good and bad smells. The annotation effort will also inform the development of NLP-based systems for olfactory information processing. Existing challenges of this task and possible solutions will also be discussed in the talk.

Title: Introduction to Agent-based Modelling for Humanities and Beyond
Abstract: The books have been read, closely and distantly, the words have been counted in all their inflections, and the pots have been classified into thousands of types. What do we do next with our data? The last decade witnessed a quantum leap in humanities scholarship as researchers moved on from describing individual data points to detecting patterns in datasets. Now is the time to take another step, this time from detecting patterns in data to explaining them. To do so, we need simulation.
In simple terms, simulation is a formal representation of hypotheses that allow us to see how likely …</p>

        <p>A new version of the GLAM Name Index Search is available. An additional 49 indexes have been added, bringing the total to 246. You can now search for names in more than 10.2 million records from 9 organisations.
The new indexes come from Queensland State Archives and the State Library of WA. QSA announced on Friday that they’d added two new indexes to their site. When I went to harvest them, I realised there was another 25 indexes that I hadn’t previously picked up. It seems that some QSA datasets are tagged as ‘Queensland State Archives’ in the data.qld.gov.au portal, but others are tagged as ‘queensland state archives’ – and the tag search is case sensitive! I now search for both the upper and lower case tags.
There’s also a number of additions from the State Library of WA. These dataset…</p>

        <p>Introduction: in this study, Cebral Loureda analyzes how will and desire are conveyed in: Ethics, by Spinoza; The Phenomenology of Spirit, by Hegel; The World as Will and Representation, by Schopenhauer; and Thus spoke Zarathustra, by Nietzsche. With the idea of determining theses texts’ degree of cohesion, the author follows a computational and quantitative methodology to compare and contrast them, as well as assess their internal contradictions. A normalized corpus, statistics and visualizations are employed so as to evaluate the terminology, topoi and sentimentality of these works.  In relation to terminology, author’s findings revealed that Nietzsche uses a highly differentiated vocabulary from that of the other philosophers, adding marked emotional connotations to his discourse. Visualizations showed the terminological commonalities between Hegel and Schopenhauer and shed light on the former bearing the highest number of semantic connections with the other philosophers.  As for topoi, results showed there is a clear dichotomic tension between conceptual and vital experience in the studied documents. Redefining this dualism, however, Cebral Loureda observed that the concrete is always intertwined with the abstract and vice versa.  Regarding the sentimental dimension of these works, examination unveiled that Nietzsche’s presents the greatest negative sentimental load. In contrast, Spinoza’s is the most emotionally balanced. With all this, Cebral Loureda proves that there is a high degree of cohesion among these philosophical works, which link reason and emotion to will, time and spirit, core notions of modern philosophy and society.</p>

        <p>When you search Trove’s newspapers, you find articles – these articles are grouped by page, and all the pages from a particular date make up an issue. But how do you find out what issues are available? How do you get a list of dates when newspapers were published? This notebook in the GLAM Workbench shows how you can get information about issues from the Trove API.
Using the notebook, I’ve created a couple of datasets ready for download and use.
Total number of issues per year for every newspaper in Trove
Harvested 10 October 2021
CSV formatted dataset containing the number of newspaper issues available on Trove, totalled by title and year – comprises 27,604 rows with the fields:
title – newspaper title
title_id – newspaper id
state – place of publication
year – year published
issues – number of issues

Complete list of issues for every newspaper in Trove
Harvested 10 October 2021
CSV formatted dataset containing a complete list of newspaper issues available on Trove – comprises 2,654,020 rows with the fields:
title – newspaper title
title_id – newspaper id
state – place of publication
issue_id – issue identifier
issue_date – date of publication (YYYY-MM-DD)
To keep the file size down, I haven’t included an issue_url in this dataset, but these are easily generated from the issue_id. Just add the issue_id to the end of http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue. For example: http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue495426. Note that when you follow an issue url, you actually get redirected to the url of the first page in the issue.

        <p>Way back in 2013, I went to the eResearch Australasia conference as the manager of Trove to talk about new research possibilities using the Trove API. Eight years years later I was back, still spruiking the possibilities of Trove data. This time, however, I was discussing Trove in the broader context of GLAM data – all the exciting possibilities that have emerged as galleries, libraries, archives and museums make more of their collections available in machine-readable form. The big question is, of course, how do researchers, particularly those in the humanities, make use of that data? The GLAM Workbench is my attempt to address that question – to provide humanities researchers with both the tools and information they need, and an understanding of the possibilities that might emerge if they invest a bit of time in working with GLAM data. My eResearch Australasia 2021 presentation provides a quick introduction to the GLAM Workbench, here’s the video, and the slides.

        <p>These two datasets are the first born-digital, normalized, peer-reviewed datasets of Harnack’s classic reconstruction of Marcion’s Gospel. The first consists of human-readable postclassical Greek, the second of lemmatized and morphologically tagged text following the openly licensed BibleWorks Greek Morphology schema. The recent deluge of critical editions of Marcion’s Gospel makes Harnack’s public domain work even more relevant as scholars turn from theology- to text-based approaches to restore Marcion’s Gospel and account for its place in the editorial history of early canonical and non-canonical Gospels. These datasets resource Marcion’s Gospel becoming a major topic of interest in Computational Linguistics research.

        <p>Ces deux dernières années, un collectif regroupant archivistes, historien.nes et juristes se sont unis afin de contester la légalité d’un texte réglementaire portant sur la communication des documents classés secret défense de plus de 50 ans. Cette intervention sera l’occasion de revenir sur la situation des archives publiques en France et les péripéties de cette lutte. Cette mobilisation et les réactions du gouvernement ont abouti à une nouvelle situation qui n’est pas sans poser de nouveaux problèmes aux historien.nes comme aux citoyen.nes.

The virtual workshop &#x27;Data Management for FAIR CMC Corpora&#x27; is held in conjunction with the CMC corpora 2021 conference. The workshop, organised with the support of CLARIN, will be held on Wednesday 27 October (the day before the conference) and will detail important aspects of data management as it applies to CMC corpora, for example, how data should be collected, which metadata to record, which data formats are advisable, and which legal concerns need to be considered when CMC corpora are supposed to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable at the end of a project. The workshop is aimed at early career researchers or researchers who are about to start a new project in the field of CMC corpora. Read More

        <p>We present a dataset of named entities in three languages: Medieval Latin, Middle High German and Old Norse. The dataset, containing proper nouns of persons and places, was originally created to extract characters from three related medieval texts. Since the annotation is on low-resource pre-modern languages, they may be important to build named-entity recognition tools for languages with little data and high linguistic variation.

University of Stuttgart Digital Workshop

Confirmed Keynote Address: Dr. James Smithies, Director of King’s Digital Lab, King’s College London
Research on ‘intelligent systems’ broadly impacts the everyday lives of citizens worldwide, from self-driving cars, facial recognition, and ‘intelligent’ robots, to algorithms that create personalized advertisements that influence consumer choice. The societal, political, cultural, and ethical impacts of advances in this field have become matters of concern – and have also shaped literary and cultural production.

In this talk, P. Gabrielle Foreman takes up what she calls the Sankofa imperative in Black digital and artistic spaces. Reflecting on the two major stands of her research as the founding faculty director of the Colored Conventions Project and as the research historian for a decade-long performance project to bring buried Black history to the stage, she discusses how digital archives and resurrectionary poetics stitch the ephemerality and partiality of the Black past-present into a quilt of historical recovery.

        <p>There’s no reliable way of downloading an image of a Trove newspaper article from the web interface. The image download option produces an HTML page with embedded images, and the article is often sliced into pieces to fit the page.
This Python package includes tools to download articles as complete JPEG images. If an article is printed across multiple newspaper pages, multiple images will be downloaded – one for each page. It’s intended for integration into other tools and processing workflows, or for people who like working on the command line.
You can use it as a library:
from trove_newspaper_images.articles import download_images

images &#x3D; download_images(&#x27;107024751&#x27;)

Or from the command line:
trove_newspaper_images.download 107024751 --output_dir images

If you just want to quickly download an article as an image without installing anything, you can use this web app in the GLAM Workbench. To download images of all articles returned by a search in Trove, you can also use the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester.

        <p>This contribution examines the metaphorical means through which political independence was translated into national identity in Luxembourgish literature between 1900 and 1940. It posits that industrialisation provided an aesthetic canvas for literary modernism and illustrates the ways in which the writer and journalist Batty Weber and his contemporaries sought to modernise a dominant ideological attachment to the soil by instituting the sky as the never-fixed embodiment of ideational change. In the arts, industry as a subject was mainly taken up by avant-garde writers, who constructed the industrial light spectacle and billowing smokes as symbols of intellectual progress and supranational cosmopolitan exchange.

        <p>The historian Gilbert Trausch stands in the focus of this research project that aims to bring together historiography on Luxembourg and Europe as well as intellectual and material practices of historians of the 20th century. As joint venture between the C²DH and the Historical Institute of the University of Luxembourg, the project will explore Trausch’s works and his working methods as well as his library, which was his main working place. One of the objectives of the project will be to inventory and reconstruct the library in a virtual space. Other aspects we will explore are the role, the habitus and the networks of Trausch as a scholar working on national and European history.

Women’s Suffrage Petition 1894 (South Australia) – another 10,638 names

        <p>We present the Game Walkthrough Corpus (GWTC), which contains 12,295 unique walkthrough documents covering 6,117 games. For each game walkthrough, we provide frequencies of unigrams and bigrams, treating the walkthrough document as a Bag of Words. In addition, we provide word frequencies at the sentence level. Furthermore, the GWTC contains a number of game-related metadata, including title, publisher, developer, year, and genre. All the language statistics and metadata are stored in separate plain text files and can be referenced through uniform resource names (URN). These URNs can also be used to derive any combination of statistics and metadata. Researchers, for instance, can investigate the most frequent unigrams for games in the “Adventure” genre. This way, the GWTC can be reused for different kinds of research questions on gaming language.

          <h3>General Models for Handwritten Text Recognition: Feasibility and State-of-the Art. German Kurrent as an Example<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

        <p>Existing text recognition engines enables to train general models to recognize not only one specific hand but a multitude of historical hands within a particular script, and from a rather large time period (more than 100 years). This paper compares different text recognition engines and their performance on a test set independent of the training and validation sets. We argue that both, test set and ground truth, should be made available by researchers as part of a shared task to allow for the comparison of engines. This will give insight into the range of possible options for institutions in need of recognition models. As a test set, we provide a data set consisting of 2,426 lines which have been randomly selected from meeting minutes of the Swiss Federal Council from 1848 to 1903. To our knowledge, neither the aforementioned text lines, which we take as ground truth, nor the multitude of different hands within this corpus have ever been used to train handwritten text recognition models. In addition, the data set used is perfect for making comparisons involving recognition engines and large training sets due to its variability and the time frame it spans. Consequently, this paper argues that both the tested engines, HTR+ and PyLaia, can handle large training sets. The resulting models have yielded very good results on a test set consisting of unknown but stylistically similar hands.

        <p>The Corpus for Idiolectal Research (CIDRE) is a collection of fiction works from 11 prolific 19th-century French authors (4 women, 7 men; 22–62 works/author; total of 37 million words). Every work is dated with the year it was written. Using programming scripts, the works have been gathered from open source platforms, for example La Bibliothèque électronique du Québec, and stripped of paratext (text not being part of the novel, e.g. prefaces). We distribute the text files, the dating, other metadata and the programming scripts under an open source license. CIDRE is the first resource of French for the study of style and idiolect in a diachronic manner (i.e. stylochronometry) on a larger scale.

        <p>We present four types of neural language models trained on a large historical dataset of books in English, published between 1760 and 1900, and comprised of ≈5.1 billion tokens. The language model architectures include word type embeddings (word2vec and fastText) and contextualized models (BERT and Flair). For each architecture, we trained a model instance using the whole dataset. Additionally, we trained separate instances on text published before 1850 for the type embeddings, and four instances considering different time slices for BERT. Our models have already been used in various downstream tasks where they consistently improved performance. In this paper, we describe how the models have been created and outline their reuse potential.

        <p>This paper presents the development of the first parliamentary corpus of written questions in the Hellenic Parliament. Moreover, we discuss a well-defined end-to-end process that has been streamlined and optimised to produce high-quality open text data based on parliamentary documents. Based on the above methodology, a representative sample of 2,000 questions from four parliamentary periods in the Hellenic Parliament has been extracted, validated, and placed into an open data repository. Furthermore, open data production is analysed, and several degrees of freedom in its application in alternative data sets are proposed and discussed. Consequently, the authors argue that this method constitutes a transferable and scalable practice that can be used by other representative institutions for the creation and subsequent study of their open data.

          <h3>Grasping the Anti-Modern Discourse on Europe in the Swiss Digitised Press, or can Text Mining Generate a Research Corpus from an Article Collection?<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

          Reading time: 20 minutes </p>
        <p>In this paper, we discuss how different types of automatic annotation of digitised newspaper articles can be integrated into the iterative questioning of the source material and the creation of research corpora out of a collection of unstructured texts (kept in a structured collection). We annotate a sizeable collection of Swiss press articles (183,270), extracted via the impresso interface1 using topic modelling (MALLET)2 as well as a naïve Bayes classifier (script by Milan van Lange).
The methodological discussion we propose is to explore how text mining can help identify historical discourses that are difficult to query with keywords because of their inherent ambiguity and how to grasp them in a large corpus. We argue that the automated annotations can provide a body of corroborating evidence of the searched discourse, to be used as an intermediary and heuristic analysis step.

        <p>This work presents an enriched version of the Parish Memories (1758–1761), an essential Portuguese historical source manually transcribed. It is enriched with annotations of named entities of the types PERSON, LOCATION, and ORGANIZATION. The annotation was done automatically for the whole collection where two researchers annotated a portion of it manually for evaluation purposes. In this dataset, we provide the tagged texts, the lists of extracted entities, and frequency counts. The corpus is useful for historians, allowing, for instance, comparative analyses between parishes and regions or to calculate the area of influence of a locality. The paper describes the creation and evaluation of the corpus, discusses its applications and limitations. This first release may be improved by other researchers interested in the historical source itself or in the technology employed in its annotation.

          <h3>Microscopic Views on a Global Pandemic: Social and Cultural Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic as Documented in Two Dutch Community Archives<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the obvious implications for public health and the economy at a global scale, has also had significant social and cultural effects: the partial or complete lockdown of public life breaks social and cultural networks and habits, and necessitates the invention of new forms of communication, contact, and inspiration. Over the course of the pandemic, various initiatives have emerged that have tried to capture this unique moment in history by collecting documentation on the social and cultural impact of the pandemic on people’s daily lives. Most of these collections were created bottom-up, either by actively approaching individuals or communities to contribute or be interviewed, or by opening platforms where citizens could directly contribute documentation. In this paper, we analyse two such citizen-generated collections of experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic: the ‘Corona in the City’ collection, assembled by the Amsterdam Museum for an online exhibition with the same title, and the ‘Dagboek Corona’ (Corona Diary) collection of diary contributions, assembled by the Dutch public historian and journalist José Boon. The paper discusses the background of these citizen-generated COVID-19 collections, assessing their scope and accessibility, and presenting a first, qualitative analysis of their content. We conclude with a reflection on the implications of the findings for people’s social life and identity, indicating how the datasets can be explored in further research and how the findings may benefit effective policy making.

        <p>This dataset contains information from more than 7,500 maritime pirate attacks that took place between January 1993 and December 2020, as well as country indicator data for the same time period. The pirate attack data was collected from the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), tidied, and augmented with geospatial data. The country indicator data was gathered from a variety of sources, notably The World Bank. The data is contained in Comma Separated Value (CSV) files. The reuse potential includes its use by anti-piracy organisations and researchers, as well as commercial businesses, in the understanding and prevention of maritime piracy. This dataset is available through Zenodo and Github.

        <p>Rumelange, a former mining city, has gradually transformed into a dormitory and transit town, largely losing its cultural identity, prosperity and vigour on the way. Combining these challenges with limits to potential spatial expansion and increasing urban density, it was the town’s ambition to reinvent itself by building the post-industrial revitalisation process upon the strong values that characterized this former mining hotspot - innovation, proximity, collaboration, community cohesion, welcoming culture, diversity and authenticity. To this end, the family house of the late sculptor Albert Hames (1910-1989), classified as a national monument and including the only preserved workshop of a late Luxembourg artist, will be transformed into a unique immersive hotspot of creative tourism.

        <p>Summer always disappears too quickly, especially when it involves navigating childcare gaps at various points. I spent almost the whole summer at home, but started to go back to campus regularly after Labor Day. It&#x27;s been a delight to have an office of my own for the Data-Sitters Club art by Claire Chenette, and the werewolf saint by Miles Smith, even if I haven&#x27;t figured out how to hang them on the walls just yet.
Existing projects
There was a tremendous amount of content work done on the Global Medieval Sourcebook this summer, creating beautifully-formatted PDFs of each text for download along with the XML. We also worked out some technical details with the project&#x27;s ingestion into the Stanford Digital Repository and the creation of MODS records for the major text collections. I wrote up…</p>

        <p>This year CHR is hosting an Open Mic session. Presentations at the Open Mic can be on any topic of interest to the CHR community. It doesn’t have to be about published research, but may also be about ongoing research or about something you’ve learned, a particular technique, or an interesting software package, a visualization technique, or whatever you can think of.
In short, it doesn’t have to be big. If you are hesitant to tell something about X, it’s probably a very good idea to tell something about it! Don’t think that everyone already knows about it (it is very likely that they don’t), that you not expert enough (you undoubtedly know a lot more about it than most), or that your idea is not interesting (it’s probably better than you think).
Presentations may be up to 4 minutes in length. Slides, videos or other multimedia are encouraged. If you have an idea for a presentation, please sign up below with a brief description of your idea.

        <p>Introduction by OpenMethods Editor (Erzsébet Tóth-Czifra): Research on date extractions from literature brings us closer to answering big questions of “when literature takes place”.  As Frank Fischer&#x27;s blog post, First of May in German literature shows, beyond mere quantification, this line of research also yields insights on the cultural significance of certain dates. In this case, the significance of 1st of May in German literature (as reflected in the &quot;Corpus of German-Language Fiction&quot; dataset) was determined with the help of a freely accessible data set and the open access tool HeidelTime. The brief description of the workflow is a smart demonstration of the potential of open DH methods and data sharing in sustainable ways.

Bonus one: the post starts out from briefly touching upon some of Frank&#x27;s public humanities activities.

Bonus two: mention of the Tiwoli (“Today in World Literature”) app, a fun side product built on to pof the date extraction research.</p>

In this new series we showcase high-quality and innovative research that uses CLARIN tools and resources. These impact stories illustrate the huge variety of disciplines that use the CLARIN infrastructure, highlight the excellent research linked to it, and demonstrate the wider impact that CLARIN and the social sciences and humanities have on broader societal issues. The first impact story features the Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon DHH21: ‘Parliamentary Debates in COVID Times’.

Playwright adapting Thomas&#x27; &#x27;A Question of Freedom&#x27;



William G. Thomas’s award-winning book, “A Question of Freedom: The Families Who Challenged Slavery from the Nation’s Founding to the Civil War” is the basis for a new initiative in Prince George’s County, Maryland, examining the local and national legacy of slavery.
A coalition of organizations and agencies is launching “Freedom Stories” to provide antiracist and social justice programs.
Joe’s Movement Emporium, a regional performing arts organization, has commissioned Psalmayene 24 to write a play about the legal challenges to slavery led by enslaved families in Prince George’s County dating back to the late 1700s, using Thomas’ book as the source material. The award-winning playwright, director and actor is the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Playwright in Residence at Mosaic Theater. The arts organization serves more than 70,000 visitors annually.
The Prince George’s County Memorial Library System will host a year-long Prince George’s County Read focused on Thomas’ book. Monthly discussion events will explore the local history and how the stories are reflected in contemporary life in Prince George’s County.
Thomas, Angle Chair in the Humanities, professor of history, and associate dean in the College of Arts and Sciences, spoke at the press preview event at Joe’s Movement Emporium on Sept. 9.
Published by Yale University Press in 2020, the book has additionally received the 2021 Mark Lynton History Prize and was named a finalist for the George Washington Prize.</p>

The Institute for Natural Language Processing (IMS) at University of Stuttgart has an opening for a doctoral researcher (or a postdoc) in the context of project CAUTION [1] to work on the operationalization of concepts from the field of narratology and on tools for computer-aided analysis of a corpus of literary texts. CAUTION is a collaboration between literary studies and computational linguistics, headed by Janina Jacke (University of Göttingen) and Jonas Kuhn (University of Stuttgart) [2], which addresses the phenomenon of unreliable narration in fiction. The project aims to advance the representational means for capturing this phenomenon, to devise a framework for intersubje…</p>

        <p>Following a discussion on Twitter, @mike.kestemont and I are organizing a hybrid/local event for CHR2021 at the University of Antwerp. We’re planning to watch (some of) the paper together with a group and maybe have some discussions afterwards. I’m still thinking about how to best facilitate the discussion between the room and the presenters.
Anybody else thinking about organizing a hybrid/local event? And does anybody have experience with this kind of thing? All tips and best practices welcome!

        <p>The open access movement, which broadly seeks to remove barriers to reading and publishing scientific articles, has grown into a broad coalition of stakeholders transforming scholarly communication. No longer confined to librarians, publishers, and scholarly communication experts, a majority of researchers have now been thrust willingly or unwillingly into negotiating the future of scholarly communication.
Researchers feel the effects of an outdated publishing ecosystem on a regular basis. Attaching a PDF to an email can result in a personal lawsuit against you. Sharing your article online may lead to a cease and desist letter. You mistakenly cite an article that was retracted years ago because it’s not properly labeled.

        <p>From its inception, the C²DH has decided to make the history of the Luxembourg financial centre one of its main research priorities. In this context, the &#x27;FinLux&#x27; seminar is held on a monthly basis. It is a place for researchers to discuss ongoing research projects in banking and financial history in a broad sense. The fundamental theme of the seminars is a reflection on which topics, actors, sources, and methods can be used to write the history of the Luxembourg financial centre.
All sessions start at 18:00 sharp and will take place virtually at https://unilu.webex.com/meet/benoit.majerus. The presentations this semester will be in either French or English. Please e-mail Benoit Majerus (benoit.majerus@uni.lu) in case you wish to participate.

        <p>When comparing topics between LDA models trained on different collections of text, it’s common for people to use the Jensen-Shannon divergence as a measure of the (dis)similarity between topics. However, this is complicated a bit if the two collections being compared have differences in their vocabularies (i.e., some word types may be present in one collection, but not the other).
For example, if collection 1 has vocabulary {a, b, c} and collection 2 has vocabulary {b, c, d}, then comparisons between topics trained on the different collections require a to be inserted into the topics from collection 2, and d to be inserted into the topics learned from collection 1. My guess is that most people just insert such words with probability of 0, but I haven’t been able to find a case where this is actually addressed in the paper.
I’m trying to think through the implications of how this issue might be handled and am looking for literature that addresses this in any way. Suggestions for stuff to read on this are highly appreciated—thanks!

        <p>Digital Public History breitet sich als weiterer Zugang in den stetig wachsenden Lehrangeboten der Public History aus. Gleichzeitig bleibt die personelle und finanzielle Ausstattung vieler Lehrstühle und Studiengänge in diesem Bereich jedoch prekär. Welche Chancen und Risiken ergeben sich vor diesem Hintergrund für das boomende Feld der Public History im deutschsprachigen Raum? Wie sehen die Lehrangebote konkret aus? Welche Karrierechancen bieten sich für Studierende der Public History?
Im Rahmen des Workshops sollen Lehrende, Studierende und Absolvent:innen aus den verschiedenen universitären Standorten zusammengebracht werden, um kritisch den derzeitigen Stand des Studienangebots im Bereich der Public History im deutschsprachigen Raum zu reflektieren und mit internationalen Entwicklungen…</p>

        <p>Late last year the Federal Government announced it was making an $8.9 million investment in HASS and Indigenous research infrastructure. This program is being managed by the ARDC and will lead to the development of a HASS Research Data Commons. According to the ARDC, a research data commons:
brings together people, skills, data, and related resources such as storage, compute, software, and models to enable researchers to conduct world class data-intensive research
Sounds awesome!
Based on scoping studies commissioned by the Department of Education, Skills, and Employment (which have not yet been made public), four activities were selected for initial funding under this program. Draft project plans for these four activities have now been released for public comment.

        <p>The reporting on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961 is considered one of the first international media events. At the same time, the trial marked a turning point in society&#x27;s examination of the Holocaust and was very much in the spirit of the Cold War. The two German states also regularly reported on the trial in various media. These contemporary video clips, audio documents and newspaper articles were researched, compiled and commented on in a two-year project with students of Public History at the FU Berlin. The results are presented in the form of a DVD.
The lecture traces the project from the idea to the implementation as a student project and presents the result in the form of the DVD.

        <p>During the last two decades, scholars have increasingly stressed the importance of culture in the history of European integration. Studies have unpacked the European Union’s attempts to sell the European project to audiences in the Member States and abroad, yet little is known about the role exhibitions played in this process. Developing stands and pavilions for regional, national and international exhibitions formed a significant strategy within the European cultural politics complex. My PhD thesis looks at the participation of the EU in the international exhibitions that hold the largest political and symbolic importance: World Expos.
In her thesis Anastasia Remes selects four pavilions as case studies: the European Coal and Steel Community pavilion in Brussels in 1958, the European Communities pavilion in Montreal in 1967, the European Community pavilion in Seville in 1992 and the EU pavilion in Shanghai in 2010. In this presentation, I will discuss how the European pavilions presented the EU at the various World Expos. I will expand on the three research questions that have driven my research: to what extent is the EU presented as a state, how is the EU’s global power constructed and how did the EU transform its message in engaging pavilions and exhibitions?

        <p>by Caterina Agostini and Francesca Giannetti Introduction Earlier this year, Rutgers was invited to become a participant in the beta evaluation of ITHAKA JSTOR’s Constellate, a text analysis and pedagogy platform. As a result, we have had early view into a rapidly evolving service that aims to advance text analytics pedagogy. While pedagogy is its main thrust at the moment, Constellate is a fairly complex offering that is structured around three “pillars”: data, pedagogy, and research. For readers who are familiar with JSTOR’s Data for Research (DfR) program, which has provided researchers with bibliographic metadata, unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams for JSTOR journals and books since</p>

        <p>Hello,
My name is Marie Bizais-Lillig. I work on a large body of medieval Chinese texts. I edit these texts in XML-TEI format. I have also used Blast-based scripts to identify cases of text reuse. I am not very satisfied with the results. The project that I lead, which is entitled CHI-KNOW-PO, is funded by the Institute of Advanced Studies of the University of Strasbourg (USIAS, France).
The CHI-KNOW-PO project aims to develop tools to identify cases of text reuse and thematic cooccurrences in a more efficient way. The team will be composed of two research assistants, one postdoctoral researcher and myself.
This message is meant to publicize the job offer related to the postdoctoral position.
I am looking for someone with experience in programming system design for text processing analysis…</p>

        <p>And kind of upset. I thought the reviews were rather harsh. They seemed to misunderstand and downplay the humanistic payoff of the paper, instead discounting the piece for not following a (IMO stale) intro-methods-results-conclusion rubric, with heavy citation to related methods, as if I were only developing new tools rather than deriving new historical insights from them. I’m not familiar with this event but I thought this was more computational humanities than computational social science or computer science. What disciplinary backgrounds do the reviewers hail from?
Congratulations, though, to those accepted, and thanks to the organisers for putting this together. Sorry for being a bit petty: I’ve just been rejected from ADHO a few times now, I think for being a bit too pitched to a computational-heavy audience, and now rejected from CHR, for being a bit too pitched to a humanistic audience, and wondering where my work even belongs anymore. But I will work to improve the piece and submit elsewhere.

CFP: The Art Museum in the Digital Age – 2022
The Belvedere Research Center is continuing its conference series on the digital transformation of art museums with its fourth event on the topic. The COVID-19 pandemic, and our resultant inability to experience proximity to people and objects, has given the matter additional ‘virulence’ in museums. Although the topic of digitization was gaining ground before the pandemic, the measures taken against the virus created a very special experimental arrangement in which the digital presence of museums was no longer merely a possible extension of exhibition spaces but rather the only w…</p>

        <p>Introduction: Among the Nominees in the &#x27;Best DH Dataset&#x27; of the DH Awards 2020, the TAO IC Project (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/index.html) leads us in a fascinating journey through the world of Chinese ceramics. The project, which is developed in a collaborative way at the Knowledge Engineering &amp; Terminology Research Center of Liaocheng (http://ketrc.com/), exploits an onto-terminology-based approach to build an e-dictionary of Chinese vessels. Do you want to know every detail about a ‘Double-gourd Vase I’? If you consult ‘Class’ in the ‘Ontology’ section (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/class.html), you can discover the component, the function, from what such a vessel is made of, and what is the method to fire it. If you also wish to see how the vase appears, under ‘Individuals’ of the same section you can read a full description of it and, also, see a picture (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/class.html).  All this information is collected in the e-dictionary for each beautiful item belonging to the Ming and Qing dynasties.

The objective is to raise small contributions from a large number of academic libraries, so that no single institution bears a disproportionate burden. How does it work?

        <p>Over the last few weeks I’ve been updating my harvests of OCRd text from digitised books and periodicals in Trove. As part of the harvesting process, I’ve created lists of both that are available in digital form – this includes digitised works, as well as those that are born-digital (such as PDFs or epubs). I’ve published the full lists of books and periodicals as searchable databases to make them easy to explore.

One thing that you might notice is that works with the format ‘Government publication’ pop up in both lists – sometimes it’s not clear whether something is a ‘book’ or ‘periodical’. To make it easier to find these items, no matter what their format, I’ve combined data from my two harvests and created a searchable dataset of government publications. It includes links to download OCRd text from CloudStor if available.
All three databases make use of Datasette, which I’ve also used for the GLAM Name Index Search. One of the cool things about Datasette is that it provides it’s own API, so if you find some interesting in any of these databases, you can easily download the machine-readable data for further analysis. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>A paper published in the International Journal of Digital Humanities describes the Data Deposit Recommendation Service (DDRS), which has been developed as a prototype to help researchers identify suitable repositories for their data. The DDRS was developed from a humanities perspective to help researchers find suitable repositories that match the technical and legal requirements of […]

        <p>We’re in the midst of planning for the HASS Research Data Commons, which will deliver some much-needed investment in digital research infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences. Amongst the funded programs are tools for text analysis as part of the Linguistics Data Commons, and a platform for more advanced research using Trove. I’m hoping that this will be an opportunity to take stock of existing tools and resources, and build flexible pathways for researchers that enable them to collect, move, analyse, preserve, and share data across different platforms and services.
To this end, I thought it might be useful to try and summarise what the GLAM Workbench offers, particularly for Trove researchers. The GLAM Workbench doesn’t really have an institutional home, and is mostly unfunde…</p>

On August 19, GitHub announced software citation support in GitHub repositories. Citation information provided by users (using a CITATION.cff YAML file in the root directory of the default branch) is parsed and made available as bibtex file or formatted citation, currently supporting the APA citation style. The APA style is a good start as it is the only popular citation style that labels software with the string [Computer software] but we hope to see support for more citation styles – including those popular in computer science – going forward. Going forward we also hope to see support for biblatex and potentially @software as the bibtex entry type.

        <p>There’s a lot of rich historical data contained within the indexes that Australian GLAM organisations provide to help people navigate their records. These indexes, often created by volunteers, allow access by key fields such as name, date or location. They aid discovery, but also allow new forms of analysis and visualisation. Kate Bagnall and I wrote about some of the possibilities, and the difficulties, in this recently published article.
Many of these indexes can be downloaded from government data portals. The GLAM Workbench demonstrates how these can be harvested, and provides a list of available datasets to browse. But what’s inside them? The GLAM CSV Explorer visualises the contents of the indexes to give you a sneak peek and encourage you to dig deeper.

        <p>The Trove books section of the GLAM Workbench has been updated! There’s freshly-harvested data, as well as updated Python packages, integration with Reclaim Cloud, and automated Docker builds.
Included is a notebook to harvest details of all books available from Trove in digital form. This includes both digitised books, that have been scanned and OCRd, as well as born digital publications, such as PDFs and epubs. The definition of ‘books’ is pretty loose – I’ve harvested details of anything that has been assigned the format ‘Book’ in Trove, but this includes ephemera, such as posters, pamphlets, and advertising.
In the latest harvest, I ended up with details of 42,174 ‘books’. This includes some duplicates, because multiple metadata entries can point to the same digital object. I thought it was best to preserve the duplicates, rather than discard the metadata.
Once I’d harvested the details of the books, I tried to see if there was any OCRd text available for download. If there was, I saved it to a public folder on CloudStor. In total, I was able to download 26,762 files of OCRd text.

The easiest way to explore the books is using this searchable database. It’s created using Datasette and is running on Glitch. Full text search is available on the ‘title’ and ‘contributors’ fields, and you can filter on things like date, copyright status, number of pages, and whether OCRd text is available for download. If there is OCRd text, a direct link to the file on CloudStor is included. You can use the database to filter the titles, creating your own dataset that you can download in CSV or JSON format.
If you just want the full list of books as a CSV file, you can download it here. And if you want all the OCRd text, you can go straight to the public folder on CloudStor – there’s about 3.6gb of text files to explore! #dhhacks</p>

        <p>I’m just in the midst of updating my harvest of OCRd text from Trove’s digitised books (more about that soon!). But amongst the items catalogued as ‘books’ are a wide assortment of ephemera, posters, advertisements, and other oddities. There’s no consistent way of identifying these items through the search interface, but because I’ve found the number of pages in each ‘book’ as part of the harvesting process, I can limit results to items with just a single digitised page – there’s more than 1,500! To make it easy to explore this collection of odds and ends, I’ve downloaded all the single page images and compiled them into one big PDF with links back to their entries in Trove. Enjoy your browsing!

This is another example of the ways in which we can extend and enrich existing collection interfaces using simple technologies like PDFs and CSVs. We can create slices across existing categories to expose interesting features, and provide new entry points for researchers. Some other examples in the GLAM Workbench are the collection of editorial cartoons from The Bulletin, the list of Trove newspapers with non-English content, the harvest of ABC Radio National programs, and the recent collection of politicians talking about COVID. Let me know if you have any ideas for additional slices! #dhhacks</p>

His published work has appeared in Comitatus, Essays and Studies, Review of English Studies, and most recently in New Medieval Literatures.

        <p>Some good news on the funding front with the success of the Everyday Heritage project in the latest round of ARC Linkage grants. The project aims to look beyond the formal discourses of ‘national’ heritage to develop a more diverse range of heritage narratives. Working at the intersection of place, digital collections, and material culture, team members will develop a series of ‘heritage biographies’, that document everyday experience, and provide new models for the heritage sector.

Digital methods will play a major role in the project. I’ll be leading the ‘Heritage Hacks’ work package that will support the creation of the heritage biographies and develop a range of new tools and tutorials for use in heritage management contexts. All the tools, methods, and data generated through the project will be documented using Jupyter notebooks and published through the GLAM Workbench. Watch this space!
The project is led by Tracy Ireland (University of Canberra), with Jane Lydon (UWA), Kate Bagnall (UTAS), and me as chief investigators. Our industry partner is GML Heritage.</p>

        <p>For a few years now I’ve been harvesting downloadable text from digitised periodicals in Trove and making it easily available for exploration and research. I’ve just completed the latest harvest – here’s the summary:
1,163 digitised periodicals had text available for download
Text was downloaded from 51,928 individual issues
Adding up to a total of around 12gb of text
If you want to dive straight in, here’s a list of all the harvested periodicals, with links to download a summary of available issues, as well as all the harvested text (there’s one file per issue). You’ll notice that the list includes a large number of parliamentary papers and government reports as well as published journals.

All of the harvested text is available from a public folder on CloudStor.
The harvesting process involves a few different steps:
First I generate a list of periodicals available in digital form from Trove. This includes digitised titles, as well as born-digital titles submitted through e-Legal Deposit. This produced a CSV file containing the details of 7,270 titles. See this notebook for details.
Then I work through this list of titles to find out how many issues of each title are available through Trove. This information isn’t accessible through the API, so I have to do some screen scraping.
Next I work through the list of issues and try to download the text contents. Most of the born-digital titles don’t have downloadable text.
Once I’ve downloaded all the text I can from a title, I create a CSV file for it that lists the available issues and notes whether text is available for each. This file is stored with the text on CloudStor.
Once I’ve checked all the titles, I generate another CSV file that lists the details of all the periodicals that have downloadable text.
The code to harvest and document the downloaded text is available in this notebook. #dhhacks</p>

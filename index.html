        <p>Introduction: in this study, Cebral Loureda analyzes how will and desire are conveyed in: Ethics, by Spinoza; The Phenomenology of Spirit, by Hegel; The World as Will and Representation, by Schopenhauer; and Thus spoke Zarathustra, by Nietzsche. With the idea of determining theses texts’ degree of cohesion, the author follows a computational and quantitative methodology to compare and contrast them, as well as assess their internal contradictions. A normalized corpus, statistics and visualizations are employed so as to evaluate the terminology, topoi and sentimentality of these works.  In relation to terminology, author’s findings revealed that Nietzsche uses a highly differentiated vocabulary from that of the other philosophers, adding marked emotional connotations to his discourse. Visualizations showed the terminological commonalities between Hegel and Schopenhauer and shed light on the former bearing the highest number of semantic connections with the other philosophers.  As for topoi, results showed there is a clear dichotomic tension between conceptual and vital experience in the studied documents. Redefining this dualism, however, Cebral Loureda observed that the concrete is always intertwined with the abstract and vice versa.  Regarding the sentimental dimension of these works, examination unveiled that Nietzsche’s presents the greatest negative sentimental load. In contrast, Spinoza’s is the most emotionally balanced. With all this, Cebral Loureda proves that there is a high degree of cohesion among these philosophical works, which link reason and emotion to will, time and spirit, core notions of modern philosophy and society.</p>

        <p>When you search Trove’s newspapers, you find articles – these articles are grouped by page, and all the pages from a particular date make up an issue. But how do you find out what issues are available? How do you get a list of dates when newspapers were published? This notebook in the GLAM Workbench shows how you can get information about issues from the Trove API.
Using the notebook, I’ve created a couple of datasets ready for download and use.
Total number of issues per year for every newspaper in Trove
Harvested 10 October 2021
CSV formatted dataset containing the number of newspaper issues available on Trove, totalled by title and year – comprises 27,604 rows with the fields:
title – newspaper title
title_id – newspaper id
state – place of publication
year – year published
issues – number of issues
Download from Cloudstor: newspaper_issues_totals_by_year_20211010.csv (2.1mb)
Complete list of issues for every newspaper in Trove
Harvested 10 October 2021
CSV formatted dataset containing a complete list of newspaper issues available on Trove – comprises 2,654,020 rows with the fields:
title – newspaper title
title_id – newspaper id
state – place of publication
issue_id – issue identifier
issue_date – date of publication (YYYY-MM-DD)
To keep the file size down, I haven’t included an issue_url in this dataset, but these are easily generated from the issue_id. Just add the issue_id to the end of http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue. For example: http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue495426. Note that when you follow an issue url, you actually get redirected to the url of the first page in the issue.

        <p>Way back in 2013, I went to the eResearch Australasia conference as the manager of Trove to talk about new research possibilities using the Trove API. Eight years years later I was back, still spruiking the possibilities of Trove data. This time, however, I was discussing Trove in the broader context of GLAM data – all the exciting possibilities that have emerged as galleries, libraries, archives and museums make more of their collections available in machine-readable form. The big question is, of course, how do researchers, particularly those in the humanities, make use of that data? The GLAM Workbench is my attempt to address that question – to provide humanities researchers with both the tools and information they need, and an understanding of the possibilities that might emerge if they invest a bit of time in working with GLAM data. My eResearch Australasia 2021 presentation provides a quick introduction to the GLAM Workbench, here’s the video, and the slides.

        <p>An eye-tracking data set is described of 102 participants reading three Dutch literary short stories each (7790 words in total per participant). The pre-processed data set includes (1) Fixation report, (2) Saccade report, (3) Interest Area report, (4) Trial report (aggregated data for each page), (5) Sample report (sampling rate &#x3D; 500 Hz), (6) Questionnaire data on reading experiences and participant characteristics, and (7) word characteristics for all words (with the potential of calculating additional word characteristics). It is stored on DANS, and can be used to study word characteristics or literary reading and all facets of eye movements.

        <p>These two datasets are the first born-digital, normalized, peer-reviewed datasets of Harnack’s classic reconstruction of Marcion’s Gospel. The first consists of human-readable postclassical Greek, the second of lemmatized and morphologically tagged text following the openly licensed BibleWorks Greek Morphology schema. The recent deluge of critical editions of Marcion’s Gospel makes Harnack’s public domain work even more relevant as scholars turn from theology- to text-based approaches to restore Marcion’s Gospel and account for its place in the editorial history of early canonical and non-canonical Gospels. These datasets resource Marcion’s Gospel becoming a major topic of interest in Computational Linguistics research.

        <p>Ces deux dernières années, un collectif regroupant archivistes, historien.nes et juristes se sont unis afin de contester la légalité d’un texte réglementaire portant sur la communication des documents classés secret défense de plus de 50 ans. Cette intervention sera l’occasion de revenir sur la situation des archives publiques en France et les péripéties de cette lutte. Cette mobilisation et les réactions du gouvernement ont abouti à une nouvelle situation qui n’est pas sans poser de nouveaux problèmes aux historien.nes comme aux citoyen.nes.

The virtual workshop &#x27;Data Management for FAIR CMC Corpora&#x27; is held in conjunction with the CMC corpora 2021 conference. The workshop, organised with the support of CLARIN, will be held on Wednesday 27 October (the day before the conference) and will detail important aspects of data management as it applies to CMC corpora, for example, how data should be collected, which metadata to record, which data formats are advisable, and which legal concerns need to be considered when CMC corpora are supposed to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable at the end of a project. The workshop is aimed at early career researchers or researchers who are about to start a new project in the field of CMC corpora. Read More

        <p>We present a dataset of named entities in three languages: Medieval Latin, Middle High German and Old Norse.

Since the annotation is on low-resource pre-modern languages, they may be important to build named-entity recognition tools for languages with little data and high linguistic variation.

University of Stuttgart Digital Workshop

Confirmed Keynote Address: Dr. James Smithies, Director of King’s Digital Lab, King’s College London
Research on ‘intelligent systems’ broadly impacts the everyday lives of citizens worldwide, from self-driving cars, facial recognition, and ‘intelligent’ robots, to algorithms that create personalized advertisements that influence consumer choice. The societal, political, cultural, and ethical impacts of advances in this field have become matters of concern – and have also shaped literary and cultural production.

In this talk, P. Gabrielle Foreman takes up what she calls the Sankofa imperative in Black digital and artistic spaces. Reflecting on the two major stands of her research as the founding faculty director of the Colored Conventions Project and as the research historian for a decade-long performance project to bring buried Black history to the stage, she discusses how digital archives and resurrectionary poetics stitch the ephemerality and partiality of the Black past-present into a quilt of historical recovery.
P. Gabrielle Foreman is a poet&#x27;s daughter and interdisciplinary scholar raised on the South Side of Chicago and Venice Beach, California. She is the founding faculty director of the award-winning Colored Conventions Proj…</p>

        <p>There’s no reliable way of downloading an image of a Trove newspaper article from the web interface. The image download option produces an HTML page with embedded images, and the article is often sliced into pieces to fit the page.
This Python package includes tools to download articles as complete JPEG images. If an article is printed across multiple newspaper pages, multiple images will be downloaded – one for each page. It’s intended for integration into other tools and processing workflows, or for people who like working on the command line.
You can use it as a library:
from trove_newspaper_images.articles import download_images

images &#x3D; download_images(&#x27;107024751&#x27;)

Or from the command line:
trove_newspaper_images.download 107024751 --output_dir images

If you just want to quickly download an article as an image without installing anything, you can use this web app in the GLAM Workbench. To download images of all articles returned by a search in Trove, you can also use the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester.

        <p>This contribution examines the metaphorical means through which political independence was translated into national identity in Luxembourgish literature between 1900 and 1940. It posits that industrialisation provided an aesthetic canvas for literary modernism and illustrates the ways in which the writer and journalist Batty Weber and his contemporaries sought to modernise a dominant ideological attachment to the soil by instituting the sky as the never-fixed embodiment of ideational change. In the arts, industry as a subject was mainly taken up by avant-garde writers, who constructed the industrial light spectacle and billowing smokes as symbols of intellectual progress and supranational cosmopolitan exchange. Through celebrating the replacement of nature by the machine as the triumph of …</p>

        <p>The historian Gilbert Trausch stands in the focus of this research project that aims to bring together historiography on Luxembourg and Europe as well as intellectual and material practices of historians of the 20th century. As joint venture between the C²DH and the Historical Institute of the University of Luxembourg, the project will explore Trausch’s works and his working methods as well as his library, which was his main working place. One of the objectives of the project will be to inventory and reconstruct the library in a virtual space. Other aspects we will explore are the role, the habitus and the networks of Trausch as a scholar working on national and European history.

        <p>We present the Game Walkthrough Corpus (GWTC), which contains 12,295 unique walkthrough documents covering 6,117 games. For each game walkthrough, we provide frequencies of unigrams and bigrams, treating the walkthrough document as a Bag of Words. In addition, we provide word frequencies at the sentence level. Furthermore, the GWTC contains a number of game-related metadata, including title, publisher, developer, year, and genre. All the language statistics and metadata are stored in separate plain text files and can be referenced through uniform resource names (URN). These URNs can also be used to derive any combination of statistics and metadata. Researchers, for instance, can investigate the most frequent unigrams for games in the “Adventure” genre. This way, the GWTC can be reused for different kinds of research questions on gaming language.

        <p>Existing text recognition engines enables to train general models to recognize not only one specific hand but a multitude of historical hands within a particular script, and from a rather large time period (more than 100 years). This paper compares different text recognition engines and their performance on a test set independent of the training and validation sets. We argue that both, test set and ground truth, should be made available by researchers as part of a shared task to allow for the comparison of engines. This will give insight into the range of possible options for institutions in need of recognition models. As a test set, we provide a data set consisting of 2,426 lines which have been randomly selected from meeting minutes of the Swiss Federal Council from 1848 to 1903. To our knowledge, neither the aforementioned text lines, which we take as ground truth, nor the multitude of different hands within this corpus have ever been used to train handwritten text recognition models. In addition, the data set used is perfect for making comparisons involving recognition engines and large training sets due to its variability and the time frame it spans. Consequently, this paper argues that both the tested engines, HTR+ and PyLaia, can handle large training sets. The resulting models have yielded very good results on a test set consisting of unknown but stylistically similar hands.

        <p>The Corpus for Idiolectal Research (CIDRE) is a collection of fiction works from 11 prolific 19th-century French authors (4 women, 7 men; 22–62 works/author; total of 37 million words). Every work is dated with the year it was written. Using programming scripts, the works have been gathered from open source platforms, for example La Bibliothèque électronique du Québec, and stripped of paratext (text not being part of the novel, e.g. prefaces). We distribute the text files, the dating, other metadata and the programming scripts under an open source license. CIDRE is the first resource of French for the study of style and idiolect in a diachronic manner (i.e. stylochronometry) on a larger scale.

        <p>We present four types of neural language models trained on a large historical dataset of books in English, published between 1760 and 1900, and comprised of ≈5.1 billion tokens. The language model architectures include word type embeddings (word2vec and fastText) and contextualized models (BERT and Flair). For each architecture, we trained a model instance using the whole dataset. Additionally, we trained separate instances on text published before 1850 for the type embeddings, and four instances considering different time slices for BERT. Our models have already been used in various downstream tasks where they consistently improved performance. In this paper, we describe how the models have been created and outline their reuse potential.

        <p>This paper presents the development of the first parliamentary corpus of written questions in the Hellenic Parliament. Moreover, we discuss a well-defined end-to-end process that has been streamlined and optimised to produce high-quality open text data based on parliamentary documents. Based on the above methodology, a representative sample of 2,000 questions from four parliamentary periods in the Hellenic Parliament has been extracted, validated, and placed into an open data repository. Furthermore, open data production is analysed, and several degrees of freedom in its application in alternative data sets are proposed and discussed. Consequently, the authors argue that this method constitutes a transferable and scalable practice that can be used by other representative institutions for the creation and subsequent study of their open data.

        <p>In this paper, we discuss how different types of automatic annotation of digitised newspaper articles can be integrated into the iterative questioning of the source material and the creation of research corpora out of a collection of unstructured texts (kept in a structured collection). We annotate a sizeable collection of Swiss press articles (183,270), extracted via the impresso interface1 using topic modelling (MALLET)2 as well as a naïve Bayes classifier (script by Milan van Lange).
The methodological discussion we propose is to explore how text mining can help identify historical discourses that are difficult to query with keywords because of their inherent ambiguity and how to grasp them in a large corpus. We argue that the automated annotations can provide a body of corroborating evidence of the searched discourse, to be used as an intermediary and heuristic analysis step.

        <p>This work presents an enriched version of the Parish Memories (1758–1761), an essential Portuguese historical source manually transcribed. It is enriched with annotations of named entities of the types PERSON, LOCATION, and ORGANIZATION. The annotation was done automatically for the whole collection where two researchers annotated a portion of it manually for evaluation purposes. In this dataset, we provide the tagged texts, the lists of extracted entities, and frequency counts. The corpus is useful for historians, allowing, for instance, comparative analyses between parishes and regions or to calculate the area of influence of a locality. The paper describes the creation and evaluation of the corpus, discusses its applications and limitations. This first release may be improved by other researchers interested in the historical source itself or in the technology employed in its annotation.

          <h3>Microscopic Views on a Global Pandemic: Social and Cultural Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic as Documented in Two Dutch Community Archives<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the obvious implications for public health and the economy at a global scale, has also had significant social and cultural effects: the partial or complete lockdown of public life breaks social and cultural networks and habits, and necessitates the invention of new forms of communication, contact, and inspiration. Over the course of the pandemic, various initiatives have emerged that have tried to capture this unique moment in history by collecting documentation on the social and cultural impact of the pandemic on people’s daily lives. Most of these collections were created bottom-up, either by actively approaching individuals or communities to contribute or be interviewed, or by opening platforms where citizens could directly contribute documentation. In this paper, we analyse two such citizen-generated collections of experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic: the ‘Corona in the City’ collection, assembled by the Amsterdam Museum for an online exhibition with the same title, and the ‘Dagboek Corona’ (Corona Diary) collection of diary contributions, assembled by the Dutch public historian and journalist José Boon. The paper discusses the background of these citizen-generated COVID-19 collections, assessing their scope and accessibility, and presenting a first, qualitative analysis of their content. We conclude with a reflection on the implications of the findings for people’s social life and identity, indicating how the datasets can be explored in further research and how the findings may benefit effective policy making.

        <p>This dataset contains information from more than 7,500 maritime pirate attacks that took place between January 1993 and December 2020, as well as country indicator data for the same time period. The pirate attack data was collected from the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), tidied, and augmented with geospatial data. The country indicator data was gathered from a variety of sources, notably The World Bank. The data is contained in Comma Separated Value (CSV) files. The reuse potential includes its use by anti-piracy organisations and researchers, as well as commercial businesses, in the understanding and prevention of maritime piracy. This dataset is available through Zenodo and Github.

        <p>Rumelange, a former mining city, has gradually transformed into a dormitory and transit town, largely losing its cultural identity, prosperity and vigour on the way. Combining these challenges with limits to potential spatial expansion and increasing urban density, it was the town’s ambition to reinvent itself by building the post-industrial revitalisation process upon the strong values that characterized this former mining hotspot - innovation, proximity, collaboration, community cohesion, welcoming culture, diversity and authenticity. To this end, the family house of the late sculptor Albert Hames (1910-1989), classified as a national monument and including the only preserved workshop of a late Luxembourg artist, will be transformed into a unique immersive hotspot of creative tourism.

        <p>After Najiba Hussaini was killed in July 2017 by a Taliban suicide bomber, her fiancé-to-be Hussain Rezai decided that the best way to honour her memory would be to found a library in her name. The Najiba Hussaini Memorial Library grew into a collection of more than 12,000 volumes and a computer lab, helping to [...]

        <p>This year CHR is hosting an Open Mic session. Presentations at the Open Mic can be on any topic of interest to the CHR community. It doesn’t have to be about published research, but may also be about ongoing research or about something you’ve learned, a particular technique, or an interesting software package, a visualization technique, or whatever you can think of.
In short, it doesn’t have to be big. If you are hesitant to tell something about X, it’s probably a very good idea to tell something about it! Don’t think that everyone already knows about it (it is very likely that they don’t), that you not expert enough (you undoubtedly know a lot more about it than most), or that your idea is not interesting (it’s probably better than you think).
Presentations may be up to 4 minutes in length. Slides, videos or other multimedia are encouraged. If you have an idea for a presentation, please sign up below with a brief description of your idea.

        <p>Introduction by OpenMethods Editor (Erzsébet Tóth-Czifra): Research on date extractions from literature brings us closer to answering big questions of “when literature takes place”.  As Frank Fischer&#x27;s blog post, First of May in German literature shows, beyond mere quantification, this line of research also yields insights on the cultural significance of certain dates. In this case, the significance of 1st of May in German literature (as reflected in the &quot;Corpus of German-Language Fiction&quot; dataset) was determined with the help of a freely accessible data set and the open access tool HeidelTime. The brief description of the workflow is a smart demonstration of the potential of open DH methods and data sharing in sustainable ways.

Bonus one: the post starts out from briefly touching upon some of Frank&#x27;s public humanities activities.

Bonus two: mention of the Tiwoli (“Today in World Literature”) app, a fun side product built on to pof the date extraction research.</p>

In this new series we showcase high-quality and innovative research that uses CLARIN tools and resources. These impact stories illustrate the huge variety of disciplines that use the CLARIN infrastructure, highlight the excellent research linked to it, and demonstrate the wider impact that CLARIN and the social sciences and humanities have on broader societal issues. The first impact story features the Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon DHH21: ‘Parliamentary Debates in COVID Times’.

Playwright adapting Thomas&#x27; &#x27;A Question of Freedom&#x27;



William G. Thomas’s award-winning book, “A Question of Freedom: The Families Who Challenged Slavery from the Nation’s Founding to the Civil War” is the basis for a new initiative in Prince George’s County, Maryland, examining the local and national legacy of slavery.
A coalition of organizations and agencies is launching “Freedom Stories” to provide antiracist and social justice programs.
Joe’s Movement Emporium, a regional performing arts organization, has commissioned Psalmayene 24 to write a play about the legal challenges to slavery led by enslaved families in Prince George’s County dating back to the late 1700s, using Thomas’ book as the source material. The award-winning playwright, director and actor is the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Playwright in Residence at Mosaic Theater. The arts organization serves more than 70,000 visitors annually.
The Prince George’s County Memorial Library System will host a year-long Prince George’s County Read focused on Thomas’ book. Monthly discussion events will explore the local history and how the stories are reflected in contemporary life in Prince George’s County.
Thomas, Angle Chair in the Humanities, professor of history, and associate dean in the College of Arts and Sciences, spoke at the press preview event at Joe’s Movement Emporium on Sept. 9.
Published by Yale University Press in 2020, the book has additionally received the 2021 Mark Lynton History Prize and was named a finalist for the George Washington Prize.</p>

The Institute for Natural Language Processing (IMS) at University of Stuttgart has an opening for a doctoral researcher (or a postdoc) in the context of project CAUTION [1] to work on the operationalization of concepts from the field of narratology and on tools for computer-aided analysis of a corpus of literary texts. CAUTION is a collaboration between literary studies and computational linguistics, headed by Janina Jacke (University of Göttingen) and Jonas Kuhn (University of Stuttgart) [2], which addresses the phenomenon of unreliable narration in fiction.

        <p>Following a discussion on Twitter, @mike.kestemont and I are organizing a hybrid/local event for CHR2021 at the University of Antwerp. We’re planning to watch (some of) the paper together with a group and maybe have some discussions afterwards. I’m still thinking about how to best facilitate the discussion between the room and the presenters.
Anybody else thinking about organizing a hybrid/local event? And does anybody have experience with this kind of thing? All tips and best practices welcome!

        <p>The open access movement, which broadly seeks to remove barriers to reading and publishing scientific articles, has grown into a broad coalition of stakeholders transforming scholarly communication. No longer confined to librarians, publishers, and scholarly communication experts, a majority of researchers have now been thrust willingly or unwillingly into negotiating the future of scholarly communication.
Researchers feel the effects of an outdated publishing ecosystem on a regular basis. Attaching a PDF to an email can result in a personal lawsuit against you. Sharing your article online may lead to a cease and desist letter. You mistakenly cite an article that was retracted years ago because it’s not properly labeled.

        <p>From its inception, the C²DH has decided to make the history of the Luxembourg financial centre one of its main research priorities. In this context, the &#x27;FinLux&#x27; seminar is held on a monthly basis. It is a place for researchers to discuss ongoing research projects in banking and financial history in a broad sense. The fundamental theme of the seminars is a reflection on which topics, actors, sources, and methods can be used to write the history of the Luxembourg financial centre.
All sessions start at 18:00 sharp and will take place virtually at https://unilu.webex.com/meet/benoit.majerus. The presentations this semester will be in either French or English. Please e-mail Benoit Majerus (benoit.majerus@uni.lu) in case you wish to participate.

        <p>When comparing topics between LDA models trained on different collections of text, it’s common for people to use the Jensen-Shannon divergence as a measure of the (dis)similarity between topics. However, this is complicated a bit if the two collections being compared have differences in their vocabularies (i.e., some word types may be present in one collection, but not the other).
For example, if collection 1 has vocabulary {a, b, c} and collection 2 has vocabulary {b, c, d}, then comparisons between topics trained on the different collections require a to be inserted into the topics from collection 2, and d to be inserted into the topics learned from collection 1. My guess is that most people just insert such words with probability of 0, but I haven’t been able to find a case where this is actually addressed in the paper.
I’m trying to think through the implications of how this issue might be handled and am looking for literature that addresses this in any way. Suggestions for stuff to read on this are highly appreciated—thanks!

Gleichzeitig bleibt die personelle und finanzielle Ausstattung vieler Lehrstühle und Studiengänge in diesem Bereich jedoch prekär. Welche Chancen und Risiken ergeben sich vor diesem Hintergrund für das boomende Feld der Public History im deutschsprachigen Raum? Wie sehen die Lehrangebote konkret aus? Welche Karrierechancen bieten sich für Studierende der Public History?

        <p>Late last year the Federal Government announced it was making an $8.9 million investment in HASS and Indigenous research infrastructure. This program is being managed by the ARDC and will lead to the development of a HASS Research Data Commons. According to the ARDC, a research data commons:
brings together people, skills, data, and related resources such as storage, compute, software, and models to enable researchers to conduct world class data-intensive research
Sounds awesome!
Based on scoping studies commissioned by the Department of Education, Skills, and Employment (which have not yet been made public), four activities were selected for initial funding under this program. Draft project plans for these four activities have now been released for public comment.

        <p>The reporting on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961 is considered one of the first international media events. At the same time, the trial marked a turning point in society&#x27;s examination of the Holocaust and was very much in the spirit of the Cold War. The two German states also regularly reported on the trial in various media. These contemporary video clips, audio documents and newspaper articles were researched, compiled and commented on in a two-year project with students of Public History at the FU Berlin. The results are presented in the form of a DVD.
The lecture traces the project from the idea to the implementation as a student project and presents the result in the form of the DVD.

        <p>During the last two decades, scholars have increasingly stressed the importance of culture in the history of European integration. Studies have unpacked the European Union’s attempts to sell the European project to audiences in the Member States and abroad, yet little is known about the role exhibitions played in this process. Developing stands and pavilions for regional, national and international exhibitions formed a significant strategy within the European cultural politics complex. My PhD thesis looks at the participation of the EU in the international exhibitions that hold the largest political and symbolic importance: World Expos.
In her thesis Anastasia Remes selects four pavilions as case studies: the European Coal and Steel Community pavilion in Brussels in 1958, the European Communities pavilion in Montreal in 1967, the European Community pavilion in Seville in 1992 and the EU pavilion in Shanghai in 2010. In this presentation, I will discuss how the European pavilions presented the EU at the various World Expos. I will expand on the three research questions that have driven my research: to what extent is the EU presented as a state, how is the EU’s global power constructed and how did the EU transform its message in engaging pavilions and exhibitions?

        <p>by Caterina Agostini and Francesca Giannetti Introduction Earlier this year, Rutgers was invited to become a participant in the beta evaluation of ITHAKA JSTOR’s Constellate, a text analysis and pedagogy platform. As a result, we have had early view into a rapidly evolving service that aims to advance text analytics pedagogy. While pedagogy is its main thrust at the moment, Constellate is a fairly complex offering that is structured around three “pillars”: data, pedagogy, and research. For readers who are familiar with JSTOR’s Data for Research (DfR) program, which has provided researchers with bibliographic metadata, unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams for JSTOR journals and books since</p>

        <p>Hello,
My name is Marie Bizais-Lillig. I work on a large body of medieval Chinese texts. I edit these texts in XML-TEI format. I have also used Blast-based scripts to identify cases of text reuse. I am not very satisfied with the results. The project that I lead, which is entitled CHI-KNOW-PO, is funded by the Institute of Advanced Studies of the University of Strasbourg (USIAS, France).
The CHI-KNOW-PO project aims to develop tools to identify cases of text reuse and thematic cooccurrences in a more efficient way. The team will be composed of two research assistants, one postdoctoral researcher and myself.
This message is meant to publicize the job offer related to the postdoctoral position.
I am looking for someone with experience in programming system design for text processing analysis…</p>

        <p>And kind of upset. I thought the reviews were rather harsh. They seemed to misunderstand and downplay the humanistic payoff of the paper, instead discounting the piece for not following a (IMO stale) intro-methods-results-conclusion rubric, with heavy citation to related methods, as if I were only developing new tools rather than deriving new historical insights from them. I’m not familiar with this event but I thought this was more computational humanities than computational social science or computer science. What disciplinary backgrounds do the reviewers hail from?
Congratulations, though, to those accepted, and thanks to the organisers for putting this together. Sorry for being a bit petty: I’ve just been rejected from ADHO a few times now, I think for being a bit too pitched to a computational-heavy audience, and now rejected from CHR, for being a bit too pitched to a humanistic audience, and wondering where my work even belongs anymore. But I will work to improve the piece and submit elsewhere.

CFP: The Art Museum in the Digital Age – 2022
The Belvedere Research Center is continuing its conference series on the digital transformation of art museums with its fourth event on the topic. The COVID-19 pandemic, and our resultant inability to experience proximity to people and objects, has given the matter additional ‘virulence’ in museums. Although the topic of digitization was gaining ground before the pandemic, the measures taken against the virus created a very special experimental arrangement in which the digital presence of museums was no longer merely a possible extension of exhibition spaces but rather the only w…</p>

        <p>Introduction: Among the Nominees in the &#x27;Best DH Dataset&#x27; of the DH Awards 2020, the TAO IC Project (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/index.html) leads us in a fascinating journey through the world of Chinese ceramics. The project, which is developed in a collaborative way at the Knowledge Engineering &amp; Terminology Research Center of Liaocheng (http://ketrc.com/), exploits an onto-terminology-based approach to build an e-dictionary of Chinese vessels. Do you want to know every detail about a ‘Double-gourd Vase I’? If you consult ‘Class’ in the ‘Ontology’ section (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/class.html), you can discover the component, the function, from what such a vessel is made of, and what is the method to fire it. If you also wish to see how the vase appears, under ‘Individuals’ of the same section you can read a full description of it and, also, see a picture (http://www.dh.ketrc.com/class.html).  All this information is collected in the e-dictionary for each beautiful item belonging to the Ming and Qing dynasties.

        <p>Over the last few weeks I’ve been updating my harvests of OCRd text from digitised books and periodicals in Trove. As part of the harvesting process, I’ve created lists of both that are available in digital form – this includes digitised works, as well as those that are born-digital (such as PDFs or epubs). I’ve published the full lists of books and periodicals as searchable databases to make them easy to explore.

One thing that you might notice is that works with the format ‘Government publication’ pop up in both lists – sometimes it’s not clear whether something is a ‘book’ or ‘periodical’. To make it easier to find these items, no matter what their format, I’ve combined data from my two harvests and created a searchable dataset of government publications. It includes links to download OCRd text from CloudStor if available.
All three databases make use of Datasette, which I’ve also used for the GLAM Name Index Search. One of the cool things about Datasette is that it provides it’s own API, so if you find some interesting in any of these databases, you can easily download the machine-readable data for further analysis. #dhhacks</p>

Amongst the funded programs are tools for text analysis as part of the Linguistics Data Commons, and a platform for more advanced research using Trove. I’m hoping that this will be an opportunity to take stock of existing tools and resources, and build flexible pathways for researchers that enable them to collect, move, analyse, preserve, and share data across different platforms and services.
To this end, I thought it might be useful to try and summarise what the GLAM Workbench offers, particularly for Trove researchers. The GLAM Workbench doesn’t really have an institutional home, and is mostly unfunde…</p>

On August 19, GitHub announced software citation support in GitHub repositories. Citation information provided by users (using a CITATION.cff YAML file in the root directory of the default branch) is parsed and made available as bibtex file or formatted citation, currently supporting the APA citation style. The APA style is a good start as it is the only popular citation style that labels software with the string [Computer software] but we hope to see support for more citation styles – including those popular in computer science – going forward. Going forward we also hope to see support for biblatex and potentially @software as the bibtex entry type.

        <p>There’s a lot of rich historical data contained within the indexes that Australian GLAM organisations provide to help people navigate their records. These indexes, often created by volunteers, allow access by key fields such as name, date or location. They aid discovery, but also allow new forms of analysis and visualisation. Kate Bagnall and I wrote about some of the possibilities, and the difficulties, in this recently published article.
Many of these indexes can be downloaded from government data portals. The GLAM Workbench demonstrates how these can be harvested, and provides a list of available datasets to browse. But what’s inside them? The GLAM CSV Explorer visualises the contents of the indexes to give you a sneak peek and encourage you to dig deeper.

        <p>The Trove books section of the GLAM Workbench has been updated! There’s freshly-harvested data, as well as updated Python packages, integration with Reclaim Cloud, and automated Docker builds.
Included is a notebook to harvest details of all books available from Trove in digital form. This includes both digitised books, that have been scanned and OCRd, as well as born digital publications, such as PDFs and epubs. The definition of ‘books’ is pretty loose – I’ve harvested details of anything that has been assigned the format ‘Book’ in Trove, but this includes ephemera, such as posters, pamphlets, and advertising.
In the latest harvest, I ended up with details of 42,174 ‘books’. This includes some duplicates, because multiple metadata entries can point to the same digital object. I thought it was best to preserve the duplicates, rather than discard the metadata.
Once I’d harvested the details of the books, I tried to see if there was any OCRd text available for download. If there was, I saved it to a public folder on CloudStor. In total, I was able to download 26,762 files of OCRd text.

The easiest way to explore the books is using this searchable database. It’s created using Datasette and is running on Glitch. Full text search is available on the ‘title’ and ‘contributors’ fields, and you can filter on things like date, copyright status, number of pages, and whether OCRd text is available for download. If there is OCRd text, a direct link to the file on CloudStor is included. You can use the database to filter the titles, creating your own dataset that you can download in CSV or JSON format.
If you just want the full list of books as a CSV file, you can download it here. And if you want all the OCRd text, you can go straight to the public folder on CloudStor – there’s about 3.6gb of text files to explore! #dhhacks</p>

        <p>I’m just in the midst of updating my harvest of OCRd text from Trove’s digitised books (more about that soon!). But amongst the items catalogued as ‘books’ are a wide assortment of ephemera, posters, advertisements, and other oddities. There’s no consistent way of identifying these items through the search interface, but because I’ve found the number of pages in each ‘book’ as part of the harvesting process, I can limit results to items with just a single digitised page – there’s more than 1,500! To make it easy to explore this collection of odds and ends, I’ve downloaded all the single page images and compiled them into one big PDF with links back to their entries in Trove. Enjoy your browsing!

This is another example of the ways in which we can extend and enrich existing collection interfaces using simple technologies like PDFs and CSVs. We can create slices across existing categories to expose interesting features, and provide new entry points for researchers. Some other examples in the GLAM Workbench are the collection of editorial cartoons from The Bulletin, the list of Trove newspapers with non-English content, the harvest of ABC Radio National programs, and the recent collection of politicians talking about COVID. Let me know if you have any ideas for additional slices! #dhhacks</p>

His published work has appeared in Comitatus, Essays and Studies, Review of English Studies, and most recently in New Medieval Literatures.

        <p>Some good news on the funding front with the success of the Everyday Heritage project in the latest round of ARC Linkage grants. The project aims to look beyond the formal discourses of ‘national’ heritage to develop a more diverse range of heritage narratives. Working at the intersection of place, digital collections, and material culture, team members will develop a series of ‘heritage biographies’, that document everyday experience, and provide new models for the heritage sector.

Digital methods will play a major role in the project. I’ll be leading the ‘Heritage Hacks’ work package that will support the creation of the heritage biographies and develop a range of new tools and tutorials for use in heritage management contexts. All the tools, methods, and data generated through the project will be documented using Jupyter notebooks and published through the GLAM Workbench. Watch this space!
The project is led by Tracy Ireland (University of Canberra), with Jane Lydon (UWA), Kate Bagnall (UTAS), and me as chief investigators. Our industry partner is GML Heritage.</p>

          <h3>Updated! Lots and lots of text freshly harvested from Trove periodicals<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>
        </a>
        <p class="dim">Source: <a href=https://updates.timsherratt.org/>Tim Sherratt</a> |
          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>For a few years now I’ve been harvesting downloadable text from digitised periodicals in Trove and making it easily available for exploration and research. I’ve just completed the latest harvest – here’s the summary:
1,163 digitised periodicals had text available for download
Text was downloaded from 51,928 individual issues
Adding up to a total of around 12gb of text
If you want to dive straight in, here’s a list of all the harvested periodicals, with links to download a summary of available issues, as well as all the harvested text (there’s one file per issue). You’ll notice that the list includes a large number of parliamentary papers and government reports as well as published journals.

All of the harvested text is available from a public folder on CloudStor.
The harvesting process involves a few different steps:
First I generate a list of periodicals available in digital form from Trove. This includes digitised titles, as well as born-digital titles submitted through e-Legal Deposit. This produced a CSV file containing the details of 7,270 titles. See this notebook for details.
Then I work through this list of titles to find out how many issues of each title are available through Trove. This information isn’t accessible through the API, so I have to do some screen scraping.
Next I work through the list of issues and try to download the text contents. Most of the born-digital titles don’t have downloadable text.
Once I’ve downloaded all the text I can from a title, I create a CSV file for it that lists the available issues and notes whether text is available for each. This file is stored with the text on CloudStor.
Once I’ve checked all the titles, I generate another CSV file that lists the details of all the periodicals that have downloadable text.
The code to harvest and document the downloaded text is available in this notebook. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>The Trove Journals section of the GLAM Workbench includes a notebook that helps you download press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts by Australian federal politicians. These documents are compiled and published by the Parliamentary Library, and the details are regularly harvested into Trove.
Using this notebook, I’ve created a collection of documents that include the words ‘COVID’ or ‘Coronavirus’. It includes all the metadata from Trove, as well as the full text of each document downloaded from the Parliamentary Library. There’s 3,995 documents in total, covering the period up until early April 2021. You can download them all as a zip file (12 mb).

While I was compiling this dataset, I also made a few improvements to the notebook. You can now filter the results to weed out false positives, and identify duplicates. #dhhacks</p>

        <p>Over the past fifteen years, maintenance and repair practices have gained increasing academic attention, but the literature in the fields of history and philosophy of technology, science and technology studies, sociology and anthropology of technology is still focused on invention and newness. Complementing recent calls for a history of technology-in-use (D. Edgerton), broken-world thinking (S. Jackson) and a history of technology “after innovation” (A. Russell &amp; L. Vinsel), we are working on the first systematic historical investigation of repair and maintenance in a Western consumer society.
In the spirit of chasing this turn, we have invited international scholars to present their own take on the histories of maintenance and repair. These range from considering the philosophical implica…</p>

        <p>I’ve always been interested in the way people add value to resources in Trove. OCR correction tends to get all the attention, but Trove users have also been busy organising resources using tags, lists, and comments. I used to refer to tagging quite often in presentations, pointing to the different ways they were used. For example, ‘TBD’ is a workflow marker, used by text correctors to label articles that are ‘To Be Done’. My favourite was ‘LRRSA’, one of the most heavily-used tags across the whole of Trove. What does it mean? It stands for the Light Rail Research Society of Australia, and the tag is used by members to mark items of shared interest. It’s a great example of how something as simple as plain text tags can be used to support collaboration and build communities.

        <p>Hi all,
Data-Sitters Club project, I’ve put together a short survey on Python vs. R for computational text analysis. We’ll be publishing one of our “books” on it towards the end of the summer. Fundamentally, the audience is people new to text analysis who are thinking about what programming language (if any) they should learn. If you have a few moments to share your thoughts in the survey, we’d be very appreciative!

        <p>I know the Computer Vision for/with Humanities (data) community isn’t that well represented yet at CHR, and when reading the CFP I realised one way that might attract more publications from CV might be to adapt the short paper guideline. The main CV conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV) all follow the same policy with regards to dual/double submission (CMT submissions Website | CVPR 2021) which is typically followed by other CV conferences such as BMVC.
This policy doesn’t allow submission with substantial overlap; where substantial is defined as 20% or more, which is quite restrictive. But the policy also offers the great option in that papers of 4 pages or less are not considered publications, i.e.: “A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined to be a written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, was accepted.”. Explicitly accommodating this policy would make it more appealing for CV researchers that have a DH/CH leaning to submit to CHR, as it doesn’t involve choosing between venues.
I’m aware that the CFP defines short papers as ‘up to 3000 words (ca. 6 pages references, abstract and tables/illustrations excluded)’, so in theory one could submit a short paper of &lt;&#x3D; 4 pages. But 4 pages including abstract &amp; tables/figures is a lot shorter than the current ‘short paper’, and might require a different reviewing approach.
A different submission type, or shortening the short paper, would in my view make CHR more attractive for CV people. Although I understand this might go against the aim of attracting original research and to be a home for research that doesn’t fit elsewhere! Happy to hear thoughts on this.

        <p>I’ve spent a lot of time this year working on ways of improving the GLAM Workbench’s documentation and its integration with other services. Last year I created OzGLAM Help to provide a space where users of GLAM collections could ask questions and share discoveries – including a dedicated GLAM Workbench channel. Earlier this year, I tweaked my Micro.blog powered updates to include a dedicated GLAM Workbench news feed. Now I’ve brought the two together! What does this mean?
Any GLAM Workbench news that I post to my updates feed is now automatically added to OzGLAM Help
Links are automatically added to items in the news feed that let you add comments or questions in OzGLAM Help
So now there’s two-way communication between the services providing more ways for people to discover and discuss how the GLAM Workbench can help them.</p>

        <p>I’ve started creating short videos to introduce or explain various components of the GLAM Workbench. The first video shows how you can visualise searches in Trove’s digitised newspapers using the latest version of QueryPic. It’s a useful introduction to the way access to collection data enables us to ask different types of questions of historical sources.


As with all GLAM Workbench resources, the video is openly-licensed – so feel free to stop it into your own course materials or workshops. It could, for example, provide an interesting little digital methods task in an Australian history unit.
I’ll be creating a second QueryPic video shortly, demonstrating how you can work with complex queries and differing timescales. Let me know if you find it useful, or if you have any ideas for future topics. #dhhacks</p>

After the German invasion of its western neighbours, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg in 1940, the border regions reaching from Eastern Belgium over Luxembourg to Alsace-Lorraine were seen by the Third Reich as lost German territories that needed reintegration into the Reich. One part of that reintegration policy was recruiting the local female and male youth into German labour services and armed forces.
This workshop will present the recruitments in each of these areas and focus on their historical similarities and differences. Further,  it will analyse the etymology and the legal aspect of the different terms describing the recruits. The workshop’s emphasis is on the quantitative analysi…</p>

A webpage is built with HTML, via hypertext markup language. It pulls together text, images, and other multimedia into a single view. In the same way, a IIIF object is built using JSON, and links together metadata and powerful image capabilities which allow institutions to deliver ultra-high resolution images quickly and efficiently to a IIIF viewer.

        <p>Introduction: This article explores the potential use of data-driven methods to visualise and interpret the impact of Western efforts to influence Cold War dynamics using a covert book distribution programme. Based on a documentary corpus connected to the 2013 book by Alfred Reisch, which documented efforts by the CIA to disseminate books in the Soviet Bloc in the period 1956-1971, the authors use the Tableau Public platform to re-assess information science methods for researching historical events. Their analysis suggests that books distributed did not tend to have a more obvious political slant, but were more likely to have a broader universalist outlook. While it skirts around some of the limitations of visualization (highlighted elsewhere by Drucker and others) it offers a solid introduction to the benefits of a data-driven approach to a general audience.</p>

        <p>An article written by Kate Bagnall and me has just been published in a special issue of the Journal of World History focusing on digital history. And it’s open access!
The article is ‘Missing Links: Data Stories from the Archive of British Settler Colonial Citizenship’. In it we document our efforts to assemble a number of different datasets relating to naturalization. Here’s the abstract:
Digitized sources and digital methods are changing the way that we do history. For historians of the British Empire, the digital age offers new possibilities for investigating the lives of those who moved around the empire and across the world. However, much discussion of the possibilities and problems of digital history have focused on the creation and use of full text resources, skipping over the analytical opportunities offered by the descriptive systems in which those texts are embedded. This article is an attempt to fill this gap by documenting a journey through archival data relating to nineteenth-century Chinese naturalization in the Pacific Rim settler colonies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. We argue that such data stories are critical if we are to understand both possibilities and pitfalls of research in digital collections.
There’s also an GitHub repository with code and data related to the article.</p>

Since the REMIX/Esch2022 project thematically includes the neighbouring regions in a comparative and transregional perspective, this lecture is dedicated to the environmental history of the Saar region.
On 29 June,  Markus Lay will present “The Romanticism of Hell”. Environmental History of the Saar-region in the 19th-century. In Imperial Germany, the industrial region along the Saar-River was the third most important of its kind. Surprisingly, there are not many papers to be found about its environmental history, despite an abundance of source material. The lecture will focus on the relatively new field of environmental justice and present case studies of environmental conflicts.
Markus Lay is office manager of Saarland’s historical commission and was fellow of the Hans-Blöcker-Foundation. His dissertational work focuses on the environmental history of the region during industrialisation. The “work-in-progress” is planned to be presented on umweltgeschichte.net as a Digital Public History project. In his Masters thesis he concentrated on Apiarian Societies and the spreading of apicultural innovations during the 18th and 19th century in Europe.

In particular, the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) allows for high quality images and supports a variety of uses and applications including deep zoom, comparison, annotation, and transcription of digital images. With the current pandemic limiting travel and access to libraries and museums, in the Spring 2021 we founded a new DH Special Interest Group at Rutgers focused on IIIF.

Wisnicki helps launch digital project to remake Victorian studies classrooms



Following the renewed calls for racial justice and the dismantling of systemic racism in 2020, a team of scholars, including the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Adrian Wisnicki, came together to re-imagine the way Victorian Studies is taught in classrooms.
This effort to help instructors teach Victorian Studies through a positive, race-conscious lens and go beyond the Anglo-European authors typically taught in Victorian literature courses, has manifested itself in a digital humanities project, “Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom.”

        <p>QueryPic is a tool to visualise searches in Trove’s digitised newspapers. I created the first version way back in 2011, and since then it’s taken a number of different forms. The latest version introduces some new features:
Automatic query creation – construct your search in the Trove web interface, then just copy and paste the url into QueryPic. This means you can take advantage of Trove’s advanced search and facets to build complex queries.
Multiple time scales – previous versions only aggregated search results by year, but now you can also aggregate by month, or by day. QueryPic will automatically choose a time unit based on the date range of your query, but if you’re not happy with the result you can change it!
Links back to Trove – click on any of the points on the chart to search Trove within that time period. This enables you to zoom in and out of your results, from the high-level visualisation, to individual articles.

This version of QueryPic is built within a Jupyter notebook, and designed to run using Voila (which hides all the code and makes the notebook look like a web app). See the Trove Newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench for more information. If you’d like to give it a try, just click the button below to run it live using Binder.

Hope you find it useful! #dhhacks</p>

My fellow panellists described some amazing stuff going on in European cultural heritage organisations to support researchers who want to make use of web archives. My ‘lab’ doesn’t have a physical presence, or an institutional home, but it does provide a starting point for researchers, and with the latest Reclaim Cloud and Docker integrations, everyone can have their own web archives lab!

        <p>‘Smart cities’, ‘employee assistance programmes’, the pervasive language of ‘security’ – the implementation of surveillance technologies has consistently been framed in relation to moral ideas. This ambiguity has been observed by surveillance scholars for many years, David Lyon once describing the alternating ends of ‘care’ and ‘control’ which these technologies serve. Yet the study of …

          <h3>Minor change to Reclaim Cloud config<span aria-hidden="true"></span></h3>

        <p>When the 1-click installer for Reclaim Cloud works its magic and turns GLAM Workbench repositories into your own, personal digital labs, it creates a new work directory mounted inside of your main Jupyter directory. This new directory is independent of the Docker image used to run Jupyter, so it’s a handy place to copy things if you ever want to update the Docker image. However, I just realised that there was a permissions problem with the work directory which meant you couldn’t write files to it from within Jupyter.
To fix the problem, I’ve added an extra line to the reclaim-manifest.jps config file to make the Jupyter user the owner of the work directory:
	- cmd[cp]: chown -R jovyan:jovyan /home/jovyan/work

This takes care of any new installations. If you have an existing installation, you can either just create a completely new environment using the updated config, or you can manually change the permissions:
Hover over the name of your environment in the control panel to display the option buttons.
Click on the Settings button. A new box will open at the bottom of the control panel with all the settings options.
Click on ‘SSH Access’ in the left hand menu of the settings box.
Click on the ‘SSH Connection’ tab.
Under ‘Web SSH’ click on the Connect button and select the default node.
A terminal session will open. At the command line enter the following:
	chown -R jovyan:jovyan /home/jovyan/work




Done! See the Using Reclaim Cloud section of the GLAM Workbench for more information.</p>

        <p>I’ve been working on an essay for publication in a forthcoming edited collection. I wanted to explore how the practice of history in Australia had been changed by GLAM organisations making their collections available online – both the new possibilities that had emerged, and the problems that remained. In the end I focused on three areas – discovery, digitisation, and research infrastructure. If you’re interested, I’ve shared a preprint on Zenodo.
Here’s a taste:
Just twenty years ago, historical research often entailed long hours spent at a microfilm reader, browsing newspaper after newspaper in the hope of finding something relevant. The changes wrought by Trove, and other digital collections, seem revolutionary, but as with all revolutions there have been gains and losses. Alongside the wonders wrought by digitisation, this chapter has tried to highlight some of the paths not taken. The online resources we now use daily are not simply the products of technology – priorities have been set, funding has been distributed, decisions made about what to include and what to leave out. Cultural heritage collections are not just put online, they are placed within specific contexts of discovery and use. Each object, each version, each interface comes with a set of limitations and affordances that together determine what is possible. We do not know yet how these decisions will shape the sorts of histories that we write.
I enjoyed reminding myself about some early digital initiatives in the GLAM sector, but as is usual with these sorts of projects, I had to leave a lot out. It’s made me think about developing a larger project documenting our gains and losses.</p>

        <p>Here’s a new little Python package that you might find useful. It simply takes a search url from Trove’s Newspapers &amp; Gazettes category and converts it into a set of parameters that you can use to request data from the Trove API. While some parameters are used both in the web interface and the API, there are a lot of variations – this package means you don’t have to keep track of all the differences!
It’s very simple to use.

The code for the parser has been basically lifted from the Trove Newspaper Harvester. I wanted to separate it out so that I could use it at various spots in the GLAM Workbench and in other projects.
This package, the documentation, and the tests were all created using nbdev, which is really quite a fun way to develop Python packages. #dhhacks</p>

Held via Zoom, this event was part of the ongoing Reimagining Educational Practices for Open (REPO) Community Event Series. 
The Force11 REPO project was instigated in response to the COVID-19-driven sudden shift required of open scholarship trainers from delivering their courses in-person to going wholly online within the space of a few weeks or months. As leaders in their fields – Serah with The Carpentries and Marty spearheading the annual FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute (FSCI), this was a fascinating discussion.

        <p>Introduction: In this paper, Ehrlicher et al. follow a quantitative approach to unveil possible structural parallelisms between 13 comedies and 10 autos sacramentales written by Calderón de la Barca. Comedies are analyzed within a comparative framework, setting them against Spanish comedia nueva and French comedie precepts. Authors employ tool DramaAnalysis and statistics for their examination, focusing on: word frequency per subgenre, average number of characters, their variation and discourse distribution, etc. Autos sacramentales are also evaluated through these indicators. Regarding comedies, Ehrlicher et al.’s results show that Calderón: a) plays with units of space and time depending on creative and dramatic needs, b) does not follow French comedie conventions of character intervention or linkage, but c) does abide by its concept of structural symmetry. As for autos sacramentales, their findings brought forth that these have a similar length and character variation to comedies. However, they also identified the next difference: Calderón uses character co-presence in them to reinforce the message conveyed. Considering all this, authors confirm that Calderón’s comedies disassociate from classical notions of theatre – both Aristotelian and French –ideals. With respect to autos sacramentales, they believe further evaluation would be needed to verify ideas put forward and identify other structural patterns.</p>

Research institute aims to bring diverse ‘new storytellers’ to digital scholarship



The University of Nebraska–Lincoln is preparing to welcome 23 emerging scholars from minority-serving institutions for an intensive, interdisciplinary institute that will explore the platforms, tools, designs and ethical questions surrounding digital humanities projects in ethnic studies.
“New Storytellers: The Research Institute in Digital Ethnic Studies” will begin May 24 and be held virtually over 10 weeks. It is one of the only digital humanities research institutes in the United States focused on digital research in ethnic studies.

        <p>For a paper I’m currently working on, I’m dealing with several types of Gaussian distributions that signal to onset and decay of an event. Events can have a slow onset and slow decay, resulting in a wide distribution, or they can have a fast onset and slow decay or vice versa. I’m exploring different ways to compare these distributions.
comparing the entropy of the distribution, which gives a general statistic
comparing the (linear) slopes of either side of distribution
calculating the skewness and kurtosis of the distributions.
I was wondering if others had pointers and possible feedback on the proposed methods.

        <p>Introduction: Digital Literary Studies has long engaged with the challenges in representing ambiguity, contradiction and polyvocal readings of literary texts. This book chapter describes a web-based tool called CATMA which  promises a &quot;low-threshold&quot; approach to digitally encoded text interpretation. CATMA has a long trajectory based on a &#x27;standoff&#x27; approach to markup, somewhat provocatively described by its creators as &quot;undogmatic&quot;, which stands in contrast to more established systems for text representation in digital scholarly editing and publishing such as XML markup, or the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Standoff markup involves applying numbers to each character of a text and then using those numbers as identifiers to store interpretation externally. This approach allows for &quot;multip…</p>

        <p>The Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton is hiring a two-year professional specialist to work with our Humanities Computing Curriculum Committee (HC3). We’re a supportive, collaborative, transdisciplinary group that is working to integrate critical and humanistic methods with computer and data science in undergraduate courses. Because this position involves rethinking the ways computer science students are educated in history, culture, and ethics as part of their degree programs, we are especially welcoming of candidates who center issues of digital equity in their work.
Our review of portfolios (we’re asking for a cover letter and CV) will begin on June 11. An advanced degree (MA or above) in the humanities, social science, information science, or a related discipline is required. More information can be found at the job portal:

        <p>Introduction: Among the most recent, currently ongoing, projects exploiting distant techniques reading there is the European Literary Text Collection (ELTeC), which is one of the main elements of the Distant Reading for European Literary History (COST Action CA16204, https://www.distant-reading.net/). Thanks to the contribution provided by four Working Groups (respectively dealing with Scholarly Resources, Methods and Tools, Literary Theory and History, and Dissemination: https://www.distant-reading.net/working-groups/ ), the project aims at providing at least 2,500 novels written in ten European languages with a range of Distant Reading computational tools and methodological strategies to approach them from various perspectives (textual, stylistic, topical, et similia). A full description of the objectives of the Action and of ELTeC can be found and read in the Memorandum of Understanding for the implementation of the COST Action “Distant Reading for European Literary History” (DISTANT-READING) CA 16204”, available at the link  https://e-services.cost.eu/files/domain_files/CA/Action_CA16204/mou/CA16204-e.pdf

First Call for Papers
The Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics, CLiC-it, aims at establishing a reference forum for the Italian community of researchers working in the fields of Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). CLiC-it promotes and disseminates original research on all aspects of automatic language processing, both written and spoken, and targets state-of-the-art theoretical results, experimental methodologies, technologies, as well as application perspectives, which may contribute to the advancement of the CL and NLP fields.
The spirit of the conference is multi- and inter-disciplinary. Considering that the complexity of language phenomena needs cross-disciplinary competences, CLiC-it intends to bring together researchers of related disciplines such as Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Linguistics, Cognitive Science, Machine Learning, Computer Science, Knowledge Representation, Information Retrieval, and Digital Humanities. CLiC-it is open to contributions on all languages, with a particular emphasis on Italian.
CLiC-it is an initiative of the Italian Association of Computational Linguistics.
Please note that one of the track is dedicated to CL and NLP for the Humanities.

        <p>Introduction: NLP modelling and tasks performed by them are becoming an integral part of our daily realities (everyday or research). A central concern of NLP research is that for many of their users, these models still largely operate as black boxes with limited reflections on why the model makes certain predictions, how their usage is skewed towards certain content types, what are the underlying social, cultural biases etc.  The open source Language Interoperability Tool  aim to change this for the better and brings transparency to the visualization and understanding of NLP models. The pre-print describing the tool comes with rich documentation and description of the tool (including case studies of different kinds) and gives us an honest SWOT analysis of it.</p>

Working environment:
The CHI-KNOW-PO (Chinese Knowledge and Poetry) Project intends to explore the role played by poetry in the economy of knowledge in Medieval China. To do so, this project will investigate paths of circulation of snippets of knowledge and fragments of texts through a large diachronic corpus of Ancient and Medieval Chinese Texts in different genres down to the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The CHI-KNOW-PO project will  constitute and publish an open digital version of this body of texts in XML-TEI format (cf. a sample here: gitlab repository). Since existing tools can only spot lexical co-occurrences and calculate degrees of similarities through linear process, the project needs to develop new computational tools that will, for example, link synonyms…</p>

        <p>We invite contributions to the 1st Shared Task on automatic Scene Segmentation (STSS) for German narrative texts. Scenes are time-, location- and plot-wise coherent units of a story, and can predominantly be found in narrative texts like novels or biographies. Scene segmentation is needed for a high-level analysis of longer texts, but also for many areas of NLP that deal with longer narrative texts, since even modern methods struggle with processing text longer than a couple of sentences or paragraphs.
All the details can be found here: http://go.uniwue.de/stss2021, the shared task is co-located with KONVENS 2021: https://konvens2021.phil.hhu.de

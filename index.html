For several years, there has been significant buzz in academica and cultural herritage instiotuions around Extended Reality, a term that encompasses a number of emerging technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality. These tools offer scholars the possibility to create exciting and engaging experiences but does the technology live up to the hype? What sorts of experiences are possible and what promises are, at best, aspirational? Join the Graduate Student Working Group in Digital Humanities for a conversation with Jade Davis, Director of Educational Technology &amp; Learning Management and author of the forthcoming book The Other Side of Empathy (Duke) on the promise and peril of extended reality.

        <p>Faut-il avoir peur de ChatGPT ? Sorti à la fin de l’année 2022, ce chatbot, reposant sur un système d’intelligence artificielle, a provoqué de forts remous dans l’enseignement supérieur. Capable de répondre de manière cohérente à des questions parfois complexes, le spectre de son emploi par les étudiants pour leurs examens inquiète les enseignants. Quels seront les usages étudiants de ce type de système ? Comment en discuter avec eux et quelles politiques mettre en place ? Des expérimentations pédagogiques avec ChatGPT sont-elles possibles, si ce n’est souhaitables ?
Cette table-ronde se propose d’aborder quelques-unes de ces questions. Modérée par Valérie Schafer (historienne, C²DH, Université du Luxembourg), elle mettra en dialogue des enseignants et enseignantes d’horizon et de disciplines variées, intéressés aux usages pédagogiques de l’intelligence artificielle :
Pierre-Carl Langlais (humanités numériques, opsci)
Stéphane Crozat (sciences informatiques, COSTECH, Université Technologique de Compiègne)
Caroline Muller (historienne, EA Tempora, Université Rennes 2)
Frédéric Clavert (historien, C²DH, Université du Luxembourg).
Un large moment sera consacré à la discussion avec le public présent.

        <p>When the first cases of what would be later recognized as AIDS were diagnosed in France, Belgium and the UK in late 1981 and early 1982, the European Community had no legal competence to deal with the emergence of a new disease. More than that, it had no competence to act in the field of public health, which had remained the prerogative of the member states since the beginning of the European integration. But as all member states detected some cases in the following months or years, and as the fear of a deadly pandemic rose in the European public opinion, the EC, which was simultaneously going through a new dynamic of integration (leading to the enlargements of 1982 and 1986, to the Single European Act in 1987, and to the Maastricht Treaty in 1992), was under pressure to “do something” and…</p>

          Reading time: 2 minutes </p>
        <p>This conference will present current research on video game heritage in Switzerland, implying two research projects, Pixelvetica (2021-2022) and Confederatio Ludens (2023-2027). Pixelvetica provided a report on the current state of preservation in Switzerland, including guidelines aimed at politicians, heritage institutions, or game developers. We will present and discuss the conclusions from this report. Confederatio Ludens, a joint project of four universities (HKB, UNIBE, ZHdK, UNIL), will start in February 2023 and addresses a gap in the understanding of the Swiss video game industry and its cultural impact in the 20th Century. This project draws on existing research and will present and discuss the methodological challenges we are facing, for example in terms of oral history (many key actors are still alive), analysis of source code, and digital archiving. The talk will also introduce the field of game studies and its importance in understanding the broader cultural and societal context of video games.
Yannick Rochat is a professor assistant in game studies at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland (Department of Language and Information Sciences, Faculty of Arts). His research activities are dedicated to the study of video game and computer heritage in Switzerland as well as the use of video games for teaching. He borrows from digital humanities and mathematics for his research and teaching.

Public discourse, the language we use in our exchanges with each other, in the media and in political debates, shapes and guides how we view the world. Dario Del Fante and Virginia Zorzi explore the public discourse on migration and migrants, using, among others, CLARIN’s ParlaMint dataset as a resource. Looking at parliamentary debates as well as news articles, the researchers set out to analyse how migration and migrants were referred to during the so-called migration crisis (2015/16) and the advent of COVID-19 (2020) in two countries – Italy and the UK – and show how this may impact public opinion on the topic.

        <p>CLARIN Internships – Meet the Interns

            
CLARIN has launched a remote internship programme for students interested in learning how to use the research infrastructure to access and engage with digital language data with the help of advanced technologies. The internship aims to help the students enhance their language data handling and processing skills, and show them how to manage language resources according to the FAIR Data Principles. 
Our first two interns are Elton Pistolia and Lesley Messori, who are second-year Translation Technology MA students at the University of Bologna.
 

  
  
            
    


      

 Elton Pistolia
 Elton has a BA in Foreign Languages for Tourism and International Mediation and is now in his second year of an MA in Translation Technology at the University of Bologna. He has a strong background in linguistics and translation and is keen to develop his programming and machine-learning skills. He speaks Italian, English, Greek, Albanian, German, Russian and Portuguese.  Elton was selected as the best participant for the language combination EN-EL in the eMT Challenge 2022. After his MA, Elton plans to do a PhD in machine translation.


  
  
            
    


      



Lesley Messori
Lesley has a BA in Linguistic and Intercultural Mediation and is now in her second year of the MA in Translation Technology programme at the University of Bologna. During her MA, she acquired knowledge of corpus linguistics, terminology management, translation technology tools and learnt how to adapt machine translation systems. Lesley speaks five languages, Italian (mother tongue), English, Russian, Danish and Slovak and has experience in audiovisual translation, translation and post-editing. In the future, she sees herself working as a freelance translator because she simply loves anything related to languages.

        <p>In 1922, the U.S. Office of Indian Affairs ordered a photographic survey of every reservation in the West. The federal government planned to pass a law making all Native Americans citizens of the United States. The surveys would measure individual family’s readiness for citizenship. Among the Apsáalooke (Crow Nation), the Indian Agent surveyed 244 houses. While these surveys and photographs are instruments of surveillance, they also provide a unique snapshot into Crow daily life. However, the descendants of the families haven’t seen these photographs before. It is relatively easy to create a digital archive to rematriate the surveys. But is it possible to do something more? Can we reframe these images wrought of settler violence as family portraits?

        <p>New Cinema History broadened film studies by emphasising the complexity of cinema as a multifaceted phenomenon that includes the socio-economic context in which films were made, circulated, shown and received. As part of the digital turn, the discipline adopted computational methods and created quantitative research data to research this socio-economic context at scale. However, not all datasets created in this context adhere to FAIR principles, decreasing their reusability. By reconciling 14 cinema-related datasets, Cinema Belgica facilitates research into the history of Belgian cinema. This research paper documents and critically reflects on the choices made when selecting, modelling and reconciling information for the Cinema Belgica database.

        <p>On 24 February 2022, Pixelated Realities NPO launched the documentary project “The Museum of Ukrainian Victory”, with the aim of reflecting the full picture of the war in Ukraine.



 
Fedir Boitsov, the Head of Pixelated Realities, will be sharing the vision behind the Museum of UA Victory and discussing the use of three-dimensional reconstructions in the project. He will focus on how these reconstructions, whether of a destroyed home or the rusting shell of a burnt-out car, can evoke more emotion than traditional photography. The project, which is an emergency war-documentary, aims to shed light on the widespread phenomenon of confidence in victory among Ukrainians.


Fedir Boitsov - Head of Pixelated Realities. Visioner, architect and 3d artist, 3d scanning expert, producer for VR/AR, digital manufacturing.

Invited Keynote speakers:

Claire Bishop, City University of New York
Transformations stemming from digital technologies are growing with every passing decade, even if the newness of new media is gradually fading. The idea of digital transition evokes a feeling of disruption, but also of inevitability and becoming, mixing the voluntarism or the design of the artificial with new evolutionary narratives. Between a lingering post-historical atmosphere and the spectre of an era of extinctions, the certainty of the digital transformatio…</p>

CfP: UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Association launches Community Interest Groups



The Association is announcing a Call for Proposals for Community Interest Groups (CIGs) - community-driven groups which are organised around a specific research interest, an existing community of practice, or a salient issue within the digital humanities community.
These groups will serve as one of the primary vehicles for community building within the Association. They will help the Association become more inclusive, collaborative, and sustainable by providing spaces that respond to community needs.
CIGs are meant to be flexible, so that CIGs can emerge, transform and disband as priorities change within the field. CIGs will receive support from the Association, including use of the Association’s social media channels, a place on the Association’s website, the opportunity to participate in Association events, regular chances to feedback on issues related to the CIG’s area of interest, and formal opportunities to collaborate with other CIGs and external organisations.
For information about the proposal process, please see the instructions here: https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/resources/cig_cfp/
Proposals can be submitted to uk-ie.digitalhumanities@sas.ac.uk by 5:00 PM GMT on Friday, 17 February 2023. If you have any questions about the process, please email uk-ie.digitalhumanities@sas.ac.uk.
If you&#x27;d like to learn more about the Association, please visit our website at https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/</p>

        <p>Le Grand-Duché du Luxembourg est aujourd’hui une importante place financière : il est le premier centre de domiciliation de fonds d’investissement en Europe et le second au monde après les États-Unis. Ce « petit pays » joue ainsi un rôle clé dans le secteur bancaire et financier européen et international avec le soutien de nombreux avocats, juristes et autres praticiens du droit.
La conférence a pour ambition de comprendre le rôle des avocats et des juristes dans le développement du Luxembourg comme centre bancaire depuis plusieurs décennies. Benoît Majerus, enseignant-chercheur au Centre for Contemporary and Digital History décrira dans un premier temps le rôle des avocats d’affaires dans le développement de la place financière. Le regard de l’historien sera ensuite complété par celui du journaliste Pierre Sorlut du D’Lëtzebuerger Land qui se penchera sur l’émergence et le succès des cabinets d’avocats d’affaires au Luxembourg ainsi que leur contribution au développement de la place financière. Puis Catherine Bourin, juriste et membre du comité de direction de l’ABBL, qui est l’organisation professionnelle représentant la majorité des banques de la place, clôturera la conférence par une intervention intitulée « Le droit et la place financière : bilan et prospectives ».

It will intertwine case study based approach and more theoretical ones, and question methods, audiences, formats, discourses, reception, etc. to better unfold the complexity of viral contents and the key notion of influence.

Every Valentine’s Day, we invite you to a birthday party for Frederick Douglass. Although Douglass never knew his birthdate, he chose to celebrate every year on February 14th. We celebrate this date as a moment for creating Black history together by hosting a transcribe-a-thon.
What is Douglass Day?
 
Douglass Day is an annual program that marks the birth of Frederick Douglass. Each year, we gather thousands of people to help create new &amp; freely available resources for learning about Black history. We frequently focus on important Black women’s archives, such as Anna Julia Cooper (2020), Mary Church Terrell (2021), and plenty more to come in future years.

        <p>In this video, Drs. Stephanie Vie and Jennifer deWinter explain some of the tools digital humanists can use for critical discourse analysis and visualization of data collected from social media platforms. Although not all the tools they mention are open source, the majority of them have free to use or freemium versions, including AntConc, a free-to-use concordancing tool, or several Twitter data visualisation tools such as Tweeps map or Tweetstats.

Even though the video does not provide just-as-good open source alternatives to Atlas.ti or MAXQDA (an obviously a recurrent question or shortcoming that is recurrently discussed on OpenMethods), it sets an excellent example for how to introduce tool criticism in the classroom alongside introduction to certain Digital Humanities Tools. After briefly touching upon both advantages and disadvantages of each tool, they encourage their audience (students in Digital Humanities study programs) to pilot each of them by using the same data-set and not only compare their results but also reflect on the epistemic processes in-between.

Sharing the video on Humanities Commons with stable archiving, DOI and rich metadata is among the best things that could happen to teaching resources of all kinds.</p>

        <p>The TRANSCOMP Dataset of Literary Translations is a collection of document-level word frequencies sampled from 10,631 translations into English of global literary fiction published since 1950, together with a historically matched parallel corpus of 10,682 fictional works originally published in English. We provide CSV files with word frequency counts for 10,000-word samples taken from each text. The associated metadata is available in a separate CSV. These data will be useful to literary scholars and linguists working in translation studies, and those interested in the linguistic, stylistic, and thematic specificity of translations from particular regions.

        <p>Living with Machines is a large interdisciplinary research project that rethinks the impact of technology on the lives of ordinary people during the Industrial Revolution and Britain’s rapid transformation into an industrial society. The 19th century was a dynamic moment in the history of English, with vocabulary undergoing rapid changes.
Two different strands of work within the Living with Machines project collaborated to explore how language about machines changed over time. Each strand drew on different disciplinary models for research and practice. Voluntary crowdsourcing (also known as citizen science or citizen history, or crowdsourcing in cultural heritage) and computational linguistics are well-developed fields with established methods and epistemologies.

        <p>The Corpus Criticorum (1450–1650) (CC) is a pioneering comprehensive bibliography of early modern publications that feature the notion of critique on their title pages. It was constituted by collecting, validating, and curating information from pan-European, language-based, and national union catalogues. A complementary and interconnected “data package” was deposited on Zenodo, comprising: (1) a classical text-based bibliography, supplemented by (2) a CSV dataset of information contained therein, (3) the images of title pages not readily available online, and (4) a comprehensive BibTeX dataset. The CC can be reused in further internal research on the history of critique and as a model for research on the history of other concepts and ideas.

        <p>New Impact Story: Voices from Ravensbrück: Multilingual Oral History

            

  
This impact story showcases the Voices from Ravensbrück project, which has produced a curated set of multilingual oral history interviews with survivors from the Ravensbrück concentration camp for women. The new ‘Ravensbrück Oral History Resource Family’ comprises 38 audio interviews from different countries and presents a unique opportunity to study and compare these historical sources. The compelling topic and the way in which these interviews are presented makes them attractive and easy to work with, opening up many avenues for cross-disciplinary and multilingual research in a broad variety of fields. In addition, it represents a valuable resource for schools, higher education, the media, and society more widely.

        <p>Holiday Greetings

            

2022 was another big year for CLARIN!
Not only did we celebrate CLARIN’s 10th anniversary as a research infrastructure, and among other things published a book about the achievements after a decade of work, but the community has been able to come together once again in person as well as virtually at the hybrid edition of CLARIN’s Annual Conference in Prague. Over the course of the year, many CLARIN Cafés were held, research was showcased in the Impact Stories, CLARIN  training materials made their way to new user groups, and CLARIN launched its first promotional video.
On this year’s holiday card, we proudly present some of these highlights with six hidden links, including a final message from Franciska de Jong, looking back at her time as Executive Director.
Thank you for a wonderful year – happy holidays and best wishes for 2023!

  . I started to work for CLARIN in the summer of 2015, the beginning of a journey that brought many moments of discovery, the unravelling of complexity, achievements, innovation and growth. Language matters, and therefore language resources matter. So leading the mission of making them findable and accessible, and pointing out the potential for impact along many dimensions of the richness that has been collected, annotated and deposited, in growing volumes and for a wide diversity of languages, has been a deeply rewarding role. The journey also brought many moments of personal inspiration and satisfaction, not least because of the many moments of warm collegial collaboration and exchange.
And the future? The landscape of research infrastructures in which CLARIN is positioned is very dynamic and there always seem to be new horizons. But even though some of the envisaged scenarios for the future may never materialise, I trust that there will be a multitude of ways in which another generation of experts can show the way for CLARIN to be able to adapt to new conditions and policy frameworks. Being a crucial building block for any new stage that will result from the evolutionary path taken, that is what I wish for CLARIN. And of course that it can continue its role in enhancing the options for exploring the cultural and societal diversity that is reflected in language. Good vibes for 2023 and beyond!

We are pleased to announce that Switzerland will join CLARIN as an observer from 1 January 2023, with a commitment for three years. The Swiss consortium CLARIN-CH was founded in December 2020 and consists of a growing number of Swiss academic institutions.
In early 2022, the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) evaluated CLARIN-CH in order to consider the strategic importance of Switzerland’s affiliation to CLARIN

Blog post written by Iulianna van der Lek and members of the UPSKILLS project

 


Teaching and research constitute the two core activities in academia. Yet, they are typically planned, performed and evaluated separately, often by different teams. This means that many possibilities for cross-fertilisation between the two domains are missed. One way to avoid this is through engagement in research-based teaching (RBT), with a special focus on the integration of ongoing research into teaching. While the benefits of research-based teaching (RBT) are increasingly recognised, its practical and formal/administrative aspects in the area of language and linguistics still need to be elaborated. One of the main goals of the UPS…</p>

The Art Museum in the Digital Age – 2023



Monday, 16 January - Friday, 20 January 2023
International Online Conference
https://www.belvedere.at/en/digitalmuseum2023
The Belvedere Research Center is continuing its conference series on the digital transformation of art museums with its fifth event on the topic. While the 2022 conference challenged binary concepts such as analog/ digital, this year’s event critically examines the imagined cultural metaverse. In four online thematic sessions and an on-site workshop, the lectures deal with the immersive experiences of virtuality and reality, cultural heritage data, value discourse surrounding the metaverse and NFTs, and self-perception and the social role of museums.</p>

        <p>The Oregon Theater Project (OTP) dataset is part of an ongoing collaborative research project by undergraduate students enrolled in successive iterations of “Exhibition &amp; Audiences,” a Cinema Studies course at the University of Oregon. It will be updated with additional data each time the course is taught. The data set comprises geo/historical data about movie theaters (cinemas) and exhibition in the state from approximately 1894 to 1929. The data is presented on a public website (https://oregontheaterproject.uoregon.edu/) which includes maps and individual theater profiles produced by the students. All profiles, and the underlying data, are reviewed by the course instructors and edited as needed for clarification or accuracy. Profiles include, where available, the theater name, address, city, state, latitude, longitude, number of seats, owner/manager names, and a narrative description. The underlying data, shared as Excel documents and tab-delimited spreadsheets, invites historical comparative analysis of film exhibition practices across time and locale, both local and global.

        <p>October and November brought a flurry of presentations from which I’m still recovering. Here’s a few details and links.
Library of Congress Data Jam
In October, the Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud project at the Library of Congress organised a Data Jam. I was invited to spend a couple of weeks playing around with one of their datasets and to report on the results. I ended up trying to find references to countries in a collection of 90,000 OCRd books. Of course I struck a few problems along the way, and didn’t get nearly as much done as I’d hoped, but that was really part of the point – to find the problems and explore the possibilities. You can watch a video of my presentation, or the whole Data Jam.

        <p>This dataset is a model for handwritten text recognition (HTR) of Sanskrit and Newar Nepalese manuscripts in Pracalit script. This paper introduces the state of the field in Newar literature, Newar manuscripts, and HTR engines. It explains our methodology for developing the requisite ground truth consisting of manuscript images and corresponding transcriptions, training our model with a PyLAia engine, and this model’s limitations. This dataset shared on Zenodo can be used by anyone working with manuscripts in Pracalit script, which will benefit the fields of Indology and Newar studies, as well as historical and linguistic analysis.

About
The CLARIN Café on Text and Data Mining (TDM) Exceptions a Year After took place via Zoom on 8 November 2022 and was organised by the CLARIN Legal and Ethical Issues Committee (CLIC). It was attended by around 25 participants, including language researchers, lawyers and legal experts from both CLARIN institutions and the private sector. The aim of the event was to discuss the impact of the copyright exceptions for TDM introduced by the recent Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (hereinafter DSM Directive) on language research and technology so far. The event was a follow-up of a Café organised by the CLIC on the same subject in 2021, with the inten…</p>

Title: The Strengths and Pitfalls of Large-Scale Text Mining for DH
Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss how we can use digital methods to generate sustainable knowledge in the humanities. I will give an overview of the data-intensive research methodology and discuss how methods, results, and data relate to each other and must be evaluated as parts of a whole: there is no such thing as a good method, nor is there a way to know if the results are good, without considering the data. I will discuss results as a window from which we can see our data, and how we can reason about the results of digital methods. I will also present the Change is Key! research program and describe our efforts to connect computational research with research questions from the humanities and social sciences.

Title: Computational Humanities and Testing Theories of the Evolution of Social Complexity in Human History
Abstract: During the Holocene the scale and complexity of human societies increased dramatically. Generations of scholars have proposed different theories explaining this expansion, which range from functionalist explanations, focusing on the provision of public goods, to conflict theories, emphasizing the role of class struggle or warfare. To quantitatively test these theories, I develop a general dynamical model, based on the theoretical framework of cultural macroevolution. Using this model and Seshat: Global History Databank I test 17 potential predictor variables proxying mechanisms suggested by major theories of sociopolitical complexity (and &gt;100,000 combinations of these predictors). The best-fitting model indicates a strong causal role played by a combination of increasing agricultural productivity and invention/adoption of military technologies (most notably, iron weapons and cavalry in the first millennium BCE).

        <p>A CLARIN Resource Family for Sign Languages

            
The initiative that lead to this project was the result of a workshop for all CLARIN Knowledge Centres (K-centers) from 30 November to 1 December 2020. This workshop, which was established by Bente Maegaard and now takes place annually, brought together all K-centres working with Sign Language (SL) resources in order to explore ways of collaboration. One of the first agreed priorities was to create a Resource Family portal that would make SL resources more visible and accessible for users across the globe.
CLARIN’s Resource Families (CRF) are designed to facilitate comparative research, and the listings are sorted by language. A common feature of the families is that the resources all pertain to spoken languages. So, this brought us…</p>

        <p>How can we promote critical understandings of the Second World War and Holocaust via gaming as a format? In this lecture, Pieter Van den Heede discusses how the war, and the Holocaust in particular, are simulated in currently available games, and to what extent game designs can be leveraged to highlight alternative perspectives. He will do so in light of recent debates in the field of Holocaust &amp; Genocide Studies, in particular in relation to the work of Frank Bajohr, Andrea Löw and Dirk Moses.
Pieter Van den Heede is a lecturer and researcher at the History Department of Erasmus University Rotterdam. His research focuses on historical culture (i.e. how people in the past and present relate to the past), public history, history didactics and digital humanities. In 2021, he completed his PhD dissertation on how digital games depict the Second World War, and what it means for people to play these games.

        <p>Introduction: Developed in the context of the EU H2020 Polifonia project, the investigation deals with the potentialities of SPARQL Anything to
to extract musical features, both at metadata and symbolic levels, from MusicXML files. The paper captures the procedure that has applied by starting from an overview about the application of ontologies to music, as well as of the so- called &#x27;façade-based&#x27; approach to knowledge graphs, which is at the core of the SPARQL Anything software. Then, it moves to an illustration of the passages involved (i.e., melody extraction, N-grams extraction, N-grams analysis and exploitation
of the Music Notation Ontology). Finally, it provides some considerations regarding the result of the experiment in terms of effectiveness of the queries&#x27; performance. In conclusion, the authors highlight how further studies in the field may cast an increasingly brighter light on the application of semantic-oriented methods and techniques to computational musicology.

This impact story shines the spotlight on one of the initiatives in response to the invasion of Ukraine that CLARIN has supported. The distance learning course ‘Ukrainian History’ was developed by two friends and colleagues, based in Ukraine and Lithuania, as an example of collaboration between EU universities and Ukrainian researchers. The short distant learning course covers the history of Ukraine and its statehood, beginning with the Kyivan Rus’ state and its Ukrainian principalities (9th-13th c.) and then traces Ukraine’s historical development and its struggle for independence until the present day.

        <p>Introduction: Folgert Karsdorp, Mike Kestemont and Allen Riddell ‘s  interactive book, Humanities Data Analysis: Case Studies with Python had been written with the aim in mind to equip humanities students and scholars working with textual and tabular resources with practical, hands-on knowledge to better understand the potentials of data-rich, computer-assisted approaches that the Python framework offers to them and eventually to apply and integrate them to their own research projects.

The first part introduces a “Data carpentry”, a collection of essential techniques for gathering, cleaning, representing, and transforming textual and tabular data. This sets the stage for the second part that consists of 5 case studies (Statistics Essentials: WhoReads Novels? ; Introduction to Probability ; Narrating with Maps ; Stylometry and the Voice of Hildegard ; A Topic Model of United States Supreme Court Opinions, 1900–2000 ) showcasing how to draw meaningful insights from data using quantitative methods. Each chapter contains executable Python codes and ends with exercises ranging from easier drills to more creative and complex possibilities to adapt the apply and adopt the newly acquired knowledge to their own research problems.

The book exhibits best practices in how to make digital scholarship available in an open, sustainable ad digital-native manner, coming in different layers that are firmly interlinked with each other. Published with Princeton University Press in 2021, hardcopies are also available, but more importantly, the digital version is an  Open Access Jupyter notebook that can be read in multiple environments and formats (.md and .pdf). The documentation, coda and data materials are available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/3560761#.Y3tCcn3MJD9). The authors also made sure to select and use packages which are mature and actively maintained.</p>

        <p>The Australian History Industry was published recently. Edited by Paul Ashton and Paula Hamilton, the book ‘explores the complex, multi-roomed house of Australian history’, exploring academic, school, and public history, the impact of digital technologies, and the relationship of history to memory, social justice, politics, and cultural practice.
My chapter ‘Digital revolutions: The limits and affordances of online collections’ looks at how digitisation of GLAM collections has (and hasn’t) changed historical practice:
As the COVID lockdowns in 2020 emphasised, the online availability of  primary source materials makes historical research possible even when  access to the originals is limited. But the undoubted convenience of  being able to browse 200 years worth of newspapers at home masks other  issues that historians have been slow to acknowledge and address. How do we discover relevant resources? What gets digitised and why? How can  researchers use these collections to ask new types of questions? After more than 25 years, the web has its own history. What problems and  possibilities has it brought to the way we understand the past?
It’s available as a green open access preprint on Zenodo.</p>

Title: Semantic enrichment of type-based word embeddings for small text corpora
Abstract: One of the most important steps to language modeling is preparing a decently sized text corpus. As language modeling has become more popular in the field of digital humanities as well, it has become apparent that this hurdle exactly can be very high for researchers to be able to make use of traditional language modeling methods. This contribution demonstrates how to improve the semantic quality of pre-trained word embeddings that have been built using a smaller English text corpus by incorporating structured knowledge (synonyms, antonyms, and hypernyms). Using the state-of-the-art method GLEN (Generalized Lexical ENtailment model, Glavaš and Vulić 2019), the experiment shows mixed results: While semantic similarity and lexical entailment show improvements, the performance for semantic relatedness falls behind in this setting. However, limiting the training data to only synonyms improves semantic relatedness as well, which implies that using more but diverse training data is not always advisable when wanting to improve the semantic quality of a smaller word embedding model, as this goal merges a variety of semantic aspects.

        <p>The deportation of Crimean Tatars was a state-organized and forcible eviction of Crimean Tatars people that was ordered by Joseph Stalin as a form of collective punishment in 1944. It was supposed to completely remove the Crimean Tatar nationality from the demographic map of the world. It ruined the traditional way of life, social structure, and cultural institutes of Crimean Tatars. Indeed, Crimean Tatars were supposed to assimilate in exile. As a result of state-sponsored violence, Crimean Tatars became a nation in exile. After Stalin&#x27;s death they did not receive the right to return to Crimea and renew their autonomy, like most &quot;punished peoples.&quot; However, Crimean Tatars escaped the fate and managed to reshape their identity. Moreover, despite the ban, Crimean Tatars tried to return to their homeland during the Soviet era.
In the presentation the question &quot;How did Crimean Tatars returnees dealt with &#x27;homecoming&#x27;?&quot; will be answered. Studying the Crimean Tatars&#x27; return contribute significantly not only to the history of Crimean Tatars, moreover, it is important for the understanding of reverse migration process in migration studies. The research, foremost, is based on oral history interviews. So the special attention will be paid to doing Oral History in Crimea.
 


 
A historian of Crimean Tatars, Martin-Oleksandr Kisly (History Department of National university of Kyiv-Mohyla academy) holds a Candidate of Science degree, having defended a dissertation entitled &quot;Crimean Tatars’ Return to the Homeland in 1956–1989&quot;. His research focuses on memory, trauma, identity and migration. Fulbright Research and Development program fellow (2017, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). IWM fellow (2022).

        <p>Abstract
How does public history intersect with citizen science on crowdsourcing platforms like Zooniverse? This talk will use examples drawn from the Living with Machines project, a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute and British Library with partner universities, to consider this question. Living with Machines is developing digital history and data science methods to explore vast digitised corpora of historical collections from the long 19th century. Crowdsourcing was built into the project from the very beginning, both as a form of public engagement and a method for data collection. Participants comments and survey results provide insights into their experiences reading and annotating historical newspaper articles.

Title: Determining Author or Reader: A Statistical Analysis of Textual Features in Children’s and Adult Literature
Abstract: Due to the nature of literary texts as being composed of words rather than numbers, they are not an obvious choice to serve as data for statistical analyses. However, with the help of computational techniques, words can be converted to numerical data and certain parts of a text can be examined on a large scale. Textual elements such as sentence length, word length and lexical diversity, which are associated by scholars on the one hand with the writing style of an individual author and on the other with the complexity of a text and the intended age of its readers, can thus be subjected to statistical evaluation. In this paper, data from little under 700 English and Dutch books written for different ages is analysed using a statistical linear mixed model. The results show that the textual elements studied are better qualified to detect the age of the intended reader of a text than the identity or age of the author.

Title:
Abstract: Good Omens  is a collaborative novel written by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Rising interest in the book, amplified by the success of the recent screen adaptation, has aroused curiosity regarding its realization. We use Rolling Delta and Rolling Classify to detect stylistic signals from each author as these methods reveal authorial takeovers. The same techniques are applied to compare the screenplay of the show to the novel. The results indicate that  Good Omens  resembles Pratchett’s work more closely. The screenplay is correctly attributed to Gaiman, its sole author, and the comparison reveals that Gaiman may have relied less on the source material over the course of the narrative arc.

Abstract: We apply Top2Vec to a corpus of 10,921 novels in the Dutch language. For the  purposes of our research we want to understand if our topic model may serve as a proxy for genre. We find that topics are extremely narrowly related to an existing genre classification historically created by publishers. Interestingly we also find that, notwithstanding careful vocabulary filtering as suggested by prior research, various other signals, such as author signal, stubbornly remain.

Title: Boosting Word Frequencies in Authorship Attribution
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce a simple method of computing relative word frequencies for authorship attribution and similar stylometric tasks. Rather than computing relative frequencies as the number of occurrences of a given word divided by the total number of tokens in a text, I argue that a more efficient normalization factor is the total number of  relevant  tokens only. The notion of relevant words includes synonyms and, usually, a few dozen other words in some ways semantically similar to a word in question. To determine such a semantic background, one of word embedding models can be used. The proposed method outperforms classical most-frequent-word approaches substantially, usually by a few percentage points depending on the input settings.

Title: Peeking Inside the DH Toolbox – Detection and Classification of Software Tools in DH Publications
Abstract: Digital tools have played an important role in Digital Humanities (DH) since its beginnings. Accordingly, a lot of research has been dedicated to the documentation of tools as well as to the analysis of their impact from an epistemological perspective. In this paper we propose a binary and a multi-class classification approach to detect and classify tools. The approach builds on state-of-the-art neural language models. We test our model on two different corpora and report the results for different parameter configurations in two consecutive experiments. In the end, we demonstrate how the models can be used for actual tool detection and tool classification tasks in a large corpus of DH journals.

Title: Modeling Plots of Narrative Texts as Temporal Graphs
Abstract: The paper outlines a formal model of plot (and syuzhet) for narrative texts. The basic   unit are scenes and the motif repertoire instantiated in the scene. The motif repertoire   consists of three sets of (closely related) elements: character stereotypes, types of   verbal actions and action types. It is assumed that the motif repertoire is highly   dependent on the corpus which is analyzed, in our case a corpus of romance and horror   novels published as pulp fiction. The resulting information is represented in a temporal   graph which in turn is used to compute relevant information on the scenes and   characters. Scenes are also characterized by their valence and their arousal value. A second representation which offers with a topic model of the direct speech and the  narrative text a simple proxy for the types of verbal actions and the action types is also created. To assess the ability of these information structures to indicate changes   in the temporal structures three evaluation methods are used based on artificial data.   We can confirm that a very abstract representation of the plot is able to do so, but   contrary to our expectations the more information-rich model which makes use of the   topic model is not better in doing so. The main contribution of this paper is its   attempt to integrate different research proposals into one integral model. We offer a   descriptive framework and a proposal for the formal model of plot, which makes it   possible to identify research problems and align existing approaches.

Title: A Quantitative Study of Fictional Things
Abstract: In this paper, we apply machine learning based predictive models on two large data sets of historical and contemporary fiction to better understand the role that things play in fictional writing. A large body of scholarship known as &#x60;&#x60;thing theory’’ has attempted to understand the function of fictional things within literature mostly by focusing on small case studies. We provide the first-ever estimates of the distribution of different types of things in English-language fiction over the past two centuries along with experiments to model their semantic identity. Our findings suggest that the most common fictional things are structural in nature, functioning akin to narrative props. We conclude by showing how these findings pose problems for inherited theories of fictional things and propose an alternative theoretical framework, embodied cognition, as a way of understanding the predominance of structural things.

Title: Reviewer Preferences and Gender Disparities in Aesthetic Judgments
Abstract: Aesthetic preferences are considered highly subjective resulting in inherently noisy judgments of aesthetic objects, yet certain aspects of aesthetic judgment display convergent trends over time. This paper presents a study that uses literary reviews as a proxy for aesthetic judgment in order to identify systematic components that can be attributed to bias. Specifically, we find that judgments of literary quality differ across media types and display a gender bias. In newspapers, male reviewers have a same-gender preference while female reviewers show an opposite–gender preference. On the other hand, in the blogosphere female reviewers prefer female authors. While alternative accounts exist of this apparent gender disparity, we argue that it reflects a cultural gender antagonism that is necessary to take into account when doing computational assessment of aesthetics.

Title: Gender and Power in Japanese Light Novels
Abstract: In Japanese culture, the light novel – a combination of text and anime-style illustrations–is a relatively new literary form. It derives from the broader otaku culture, which is also associated with video games, manga, cosplay, anime, and other forms of Japanese popular culture. Though the light novel lacks the global reach of some of these other genres, such as manga and anime, it nonetheless attracts millions of readers across a range of gender and age groups. While distinct subgenres of the light novel have emerged, such as romance, adventure, horror, and harem, issues of gender stereotyping, power imbalances and other forms of inequality remain strongly entrenched. These issues can be attributed to how otaku culture is rooted in heterosexual male desire. This paper offers a quantitative assessment of these issues of gender inequality. We analyze 290 light novels, scraped from the Baka-Tsuki Translation Community Wiki, in terms of the power relationships between female and male characters as they evolve over the course of each novel. We find patterns consistent with issues of gender stereotyping and power differentials. More specifically, we find that female characters consistently wield less power than male characters, especially toward the end of each novel. We find some variation in specific subgenres. We conclude with close readings of two light novels, demonstrating how a power frames approach to analyzing gender stereotypes in otaku culture augments existing work on the subject.

Title: Detecting Sequential Genre Change in Eighteenth-Century Texts
Abstract: Machine classification of historical books into genres is a common task for NLP-based classifiers and has a number of applications, from literary analysis to information retrieval. However it is not a straightforward task, as genre labels can be ambiguous and subject to temporal change, and moreoever many books consist of mixed or miscellaneous genres. In this paper we describe a work-in-progress method by which genre predictions can be used to determine longer sequences of genre change within books, which we test out with visualisations of some hand-picked texts. We apply state-of-the-art methods to the task, including a BERT-based transformer and character-level Perceiver model, both pre-trained on a large collection of eighteenth century works (ECCO), using a new set of hand-annotated documents created to reflect historical divisions. Results show that both models perform significantly better than a linear baseline, particularly when ECCO-BERT is combined with tfidf features, though for this task the character-level model provides no obvious advantage. Initial evaluation of the genre sequence method shows it may in the future be useful in determining and dividing the multiple genres of miscellaneous and hybrid historical texts.

Title: Measuring Rhythm Regularity in Verse: Entropy of Inter-Stress Intervals
Abstract: Recognition of poetic meters is not a trivial task, since metrical labels are not a closed set of classes. Outside of classical meters, describing the metrical structure of a poem in a large corpus requires expertise and a shared scientific theory. In a situation when both components are lacking, alternative and continuous measures of regularity can be envisioned. This paper focuses on poetic rhythm to propose a simple entropy-based measure for poem regularity using counts of non-stressed intervals. The measure is validated using subsets of a well-annotated Russian poetic corpus, prose, and quasi-poems (prose chopped into lines). The regularity measure is able to detect a clear difference between various organizational principles of texts: average entropy rises when moving from accentual-syllabic meters to accentual variations to free verse and prose. Interval probabilities, when taken as a vector of features, also allow for classification at the level of individual poems. This paper argues that distinguishing between meter as a cultural idea and rhythm as an empirical sequence of sounds can lead to better understanding of form recognition and prosodic annotation problems.

Title: Chronicling Crises: Event Detection in Early Modern Chronicles from the Low Countries
Abstract: Between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth century, many middle-class Europeans kept a handwritten chronicle, in which they reported on events they considered relevant. Discussed topics varied from records of price fluctuations to local politics, and from weather reports to remarkable gossip. What we do not know yet, is to what extent times of conflict and crises influenced the way in which people dealt with information. We have applied methods from information theory – dynamics in word usage and measures of relative entropy such as  novelty  and  resonance  – to a corpus of early modern chronicles from the Low Countries (1500–1820) to provide more insight in the way early modern people were coping with information during impactful events. We detect three peaks in the novelty signal, which coincide with times of political uncertainty in the Northern and Southern Netherlands. Topic distributions provided by Top2Vec show that during these times, chroniclers tend to write more and more extensively about an increased variation of topics.

Title: What Shall We Do With the Unseen Sailor? Estimating the Size of the Dutch East India Company Using an Unseen Species Model
Abstract: Historians base their inquiries on the sources that are available to them. However, not all sources that are relevant to the historian’s inquiry may have survived the test of time. Consequently, the resulting data can be biased in unknown ways, possibly skewing analyses. This paper deals with the Dutch East India Company its digitized ledgers of contracts. We apply an unseen species model, a method from ecology, to estimate the  actual  number of unique seafarers contracted. We find that the lower bound of actual seafarers is much higher than what the remaining contracts indicate: at least, thirty-six percent of the seafarers is unknown. Moreover, we find that even in periods when few records survived, we can still credibly estimate a lower bound on the unique number of seafarers.

Title: Lost Manuscripts and Extinct Texts: A Dynamic Model of Cultural Transmission
Abstract: How did written works evolve, disappear or survive down through the ages? In this paper, we propose a unified, formal framework for two fundamental questions in the study of the transmission of texts: how much was lost or preserved from all works of the past, and why do their genealogies (their &quot;phylogenetic trees’‘) present the very peculiar shapes that we observe or, more precisely, reconstruct? We argue here that these questions share similarities to those encountered in evolutionary biology, and can be described in terms of &quot;genetic’’ drift and &quot;natural’’ selection.  Through agent-based models, we show that such properties as have been observed by philologists since the 1800s can be simulated, and confronted to data gathered for ancient and medieval texts across Europe, in order to obtain plausible estimations of the number of works and manuscripts that existed and were lost.

Title: Differentiating Social Media Texts via Clustering
Abstract: We propose to use clustering of documents based on their fine-grained linguistic properties in order to capture and validate text type distinctions such as medium and register. Correlating the bottom-up, linguistic feature driven clustering with text type distinctions (medium and register) enables us to quantify the influence of individual author choice and medium/register conventions on variable linguistic phenomena. Our pilot study applies the method to German particles and intensifiers in a multimedia corpus, annotated for register. We show that German particles and intensifiers differ across both register and medium. The clustering based on the linguistic features most closely corresponds to the medium distinction, while the stratification into registers is reflected to a lesser extent.

Title: Emodynamics: Detecting and Characterizing Pandemic Sentiment Change Points on Danish Twitter
Abstract: In this paper, we present the results of an initial experiment using emotion classifications as the basis for studying information dynamics in social media (&#x60;emodynamics’). To do this, we used Bert Emotion to assign probability scores for eight different emotions to each text in a time series of 43 million Danish tweets from 2019-2022. We find that variance in the information signals novelty and resonance reliably identify seasonal shifts in posting behavior, particularly around the Christmas holiday season, whereas variance in  the distribution of emotion scores corresponds to more local events such as major inflection points in the Covid-19 pandemic in Denmark. This work in progress suggests that emotion scores are a useful tool for diagnosing shifts in the baseline information state of social media platforms such as Twitter, and for understanding how social media systems respond to both predictable and unexpected external events.

Title: Detecting Formulaic Language Use in Historical Administrative Corpora
Abstract: Historical administrative corpora are filled with jargon and formulaic expressions that were used consistently across many documents. Governmental decisions, notarial deeds and official charters often contain fixed expressions to ensure that the same legal aspects in different documents had the same interpretation.  Such formulaic expressions can be used to identify specific elements of a document. For instance, a deed has different formulas to indicate whether it concerns the sale of property or the transferal of rights.  In this paper we explore formulas as a methodological devise to structure the text of an administrative corpus and make the information contained in it better accessible. We use a data-driven method to detect potential formulaic expressions in historical corpora, that can deal with spelling variation and change and recognition errors introduced in the digitisation process. We apply this exploratory technique on a corpus of almost 300,000 eighteenth-century resolutions of the States General of the Dutch Republic and find many formulaic expressions that capture relationships between the political actors involved and the decisions that were made. A first analysis suggests that many formulas can be used to add metadata to individual resolutions on various elements of the proposals and decisions that are part of each resolution.

Title: Introducing Functional Diversity: A Novel Approach to Lexical Diversity in (Historical) Corpora
Abstract: The question how we can reliably estimate the lexical diversity of a particular text (collection) has often been asked by linguists and literary scholars alike. This short paper introduces a way of operationalizing functional diversity measurements by means of token-based embeddings, and argues that functional diversity is not only a practically advantageous, but also a theoretically relevant addition to the Computational Humanities Research toolkit. By means of an experiment on the historical ARCHER corpus, we show that lexical diversity at the level of functional groups is less sensitive to orthographic variation, and provides insight into an important and often disregarded dimension of vocabulary diversity in textual data.

Title: Linguistic Value Construction in 18th-Century London Auction Advertisements: a Quantitative Approach
Abstract: Georgian England was characterised by a buzzing consumer society in which advertising played a progressively important role when it came to the (linguistic) value construction surrounding material goods. Increasingly, the perceived value of goods was not only determined by the intrinsic quality of the goods, but also by the socio-commercial discourse used to characterise them. Linguistic modifiers, such as adjectives, must have played an important role in this process – reflecting these socio-economical trends in text while also reinforcing them. Here, we focus on a diachronic corpus of over 5,000 pages of London auction advertisement pages, digitised via automated transcription and divided across four sample periods between 1742-1829. Prime methodological challenges include: (1) the noisiness of the available data because of imperfect transcription; (2) the coarseness of the available time stamps, and (3) the lack of suitable NLP software, such as lemmatizers or (shallow) syntactic parsers. Through the use of word embeddings, we try to alleviate the issue of spelling variation with reasonable success. We find that, over time, subjective or ‘evaluative’ modifiers have become more prominent in these advertisements than their objective or ‘descriptive’ counterparts – but there are different temporal patterns for different types of advertised objects

Title: The Roots of Doubt. Fine-tuning a BERT Model to Explore a Stylistic Phenomenon
Abstract: The narrative work of well-known Italian author Italo Calvino (1923-1985) features a phenomenon that literary critics refer to as &#x60;&#x60;dubitative text’&#x27;: this stylistic device consciously hinders the narrative progression of a story, by questioning its own content. We report on an attempt to model the presence of dubitative text in Calvino’s fictional oeuvre and examine whether this model can also be used to retrieve dubitative instances in his essayistic oeuvre. We hypothesize that precisely the category of the dubitative text yields interesting points of intersection between both writing modes. We fine-tuned a BERT model based on a manually annotated dataset and report inter-annotator scores. We situate our findings and model criticism in the current landscape of Calvino scholarship. While detecting dubitative text is challenging, our model provides fresh insights into the device’s surface features.

Title: The Process of Imitatio Through Stylometric Analysis: the Case of Terence’s Eunuchus
Abstract: The Early Modern Era is at the forefront of a widespread enthusiasm for Latin works: texts from classical antiquity are given new life, widely re-printed, studied and even repeatedly staged, in the case of dramas, throughout Europe. Also, new Latin comedies are again written in quantities never seen before (at least 10,000 works published 1500 to 1800 are known). The authors themselves, within the game of literary imitation (the process of  imitatio), start to mimic the style of ancient authors, and Terence’s dramas in particular were considered the prime sources of reuse for many decades.   Via a case study “the reception of Terence’s  Eunuchus  in Early Modern literature”, we take a deep dive into the mechanisms of literary imitation. Our analysis is based on four comedy corpora in Latin, Italian, French and English, spanning roughly 3 centuries (1400-1700). To assess the problem of language shift and multi-language inter-corpora analysis, we base our experiments on translations of the  Eunuchus , one for each sub-corpus. Through the use of tools drawn from the field of Stylometry, we address the topic of text reuse and textual similarities between Terence’s text and Early-Modern corpora to get a better grasp on the internal fluctuations of the imitation game between Early Modern and Classical authors.

Title: One Graph to Rule them All: Using NLP and Graph Neural Networks to analyse Tolkien’s Legendarium
Abstract: Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning have considerably advanced Computational Literary Studies. Similarly, the construction of co-occurrence networks of literary characters, and their analysis using methods from social network analysis and network science, have provided insights into the micro- and macro-level structure of literary texts. Combining these perspectives, in this work we study character networks extracted from a text corpus of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Legendarium. We show that this perspective helps us to analyse and visualise the narrative style that characterises Tolkien’s works. Addressing character classification, embedding and co-occurrence prediction, we further investigate the advantages of state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks over a popular word embedding method. Our results highlight the large potential of graph learning in Computational Literary Studies.

Title: Correlations between GoodReads Appreciation and the Sentiment Arc Fractality of the Grimm brothers’ Fairy Tales
Abstract: Despite their widespread popularity, fairy tales are often overlooked when studying literary quality with quantitative approaches. We present a study on the relation between sentiment fractality and literary appreciation by testing the hypothesis that fairy tales with a good balance between unpredictability and excessive self-similarity in their sentiment narrative arcs tend to be more popular and more appreciated by audiences of readers. In short, we perform a correlation study of the degree of fractality of the fairy tales of the Grimm brothers and their current appreciation as measured by their Goodreads scores. Moreover, we look at the popularity of these fairy tales through time, determining which ones have come to form a strong “internal canon” in the corpus of the authors and which one have fallen into relative obscurity.

Title: &#x60;Entrez!’ she called: Evaluating Language Identification Tools in English Literary Texts
Abstract: This short paper presents work in progress on the evaluation of current language identification (LI) tools for identifying foreign language n-grams in English-language literary texts, for instance, “‘Entrez!’ she called”. We first manually annotated French and Spanish words appearing in 12,000-word text samples by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway using a TEI tag. We then split the tagged sample texts into four groups of n-grams, from unigram to tetragram, and compared the accuracy of five LI packages on correctly identifying the language of the tagged foreign-language snippets. We report that, of the packages tested, Fasttext proved most accurate for this task overall, but that methodological questions and future work remain.

Title: Automatic Identification and Classification of Portraits in a Corpus of Historical Photographs
Abstract: There have been recent calls for an increased focus on the application of computer vision to the study and curation of digitised cultural heritage materials. In this short paper, we present an approach to bridge the gap between existing algorithms and humanistically driven annotations through a case study in which we create an algorithm to detect and and classify portrait photography. We apply this method to a collection of about 40,000 photographs and present a preliminary analysis of the constructed data. The work  is part of the larger ongoing study that applies computer vision to the computational analysis of over a million U.S. documentary photographs from the early twentieth century.

Title: Page Layout Analysis of Text-heavy Historical Documents: a Comparison of Textual and Visual Approaches
Abstract: Page layout analysis is a fundamental step in document processing which enables to segment a page into regions of interest. With highly complex layouts and mixed scripts, scholarly commentaries are text-heavy documents which remain challenging for state-of-the-art models. Their layout considerably varies across editions and their most important regions are mainly defined by semantic rather than graphical characteristics such as position or appearance. This setting calls for a comparison between textual, visual and hybrid approaches. We therefore assess the performances of two transformers (LayoutLMv3 and RoBERTa) and an objection-detection network (YOLOv5). If results show a clear advantage in favor of the latter, we also list several caveats to this finding. In addition to our experiments, we release a dataset of ca. 300 annotated pages sampled from 19th  century commentaries.

Title: The Computational Memorability of Iconic Images
Abstract: The perception of historic events is frequently shaped by specific images that  have been ascribed an iconic status. These images are widely reproduced and recognised and can therefore be considered memorable. A question that arises given such images is whether the memorability of iconic images is intrinsic or whether it is shaped. In this work we analyse the memorability of iconic images by means of computational  techniques that are specifically designed to measure the intrinsic memorability of images. To judge whether iconic images are inherently more memorable we establish two baselines based on datasets of diverse imagery and of newspaper imagery. Our findings show that iconic images are not more memorable than modern day newspaper imagery or when compared to a diverse set of everyday images. In fact, by and large many of the iconic images analysed score on the low end of the memorability spectrum. Additionally, we explore the variation in memorability of reproductions of iconic images  and find that certain images have been edited resulting in higher memorability scores,  but that the images by and large are reproduced with memorability close to the original.

Title: Ground-truth Free Evaluation of HTR on Old French and Latin Medieval Literary Manuscripts
Abstract: As more and more projects openly release ground truth for handwritten text recognition (HTR), we expect the quality of automatic transcription to improve on unseen data. Getting models robust to scribal and material changes is a necessary step for specific data mining tasks. However, evaluation of HTR results requires ground truth to compare prediction statistically. In the context of modern languages, successful attempts to evaluate quality have been done using lexical features or n-grams. This, however, proves difficult in the context of spelling variation that both Old French and Latin have, even more so in the context of sometime heavily abbreviated manuscripts. We propose a new method based on deep learning where we attempt to categorize each line error rate into four error rate ranges ( 0 &lt; 10 %  &lt; 25  %  &lt; 50 %  &lt; 100 % ) using three different encoder (GRU with Attention, BiLSTM, TextCNN). To train these models, we propose a new dataset engineering approach using early stopped model, as an alternative to rule-based fake predictions. Our model largely outperforms the n-gram approach. We also provide an example application to qualitatively analyse our classifier, using classification on new prediction on a sample of 1,800 manuscripts ranging from the 9th century to the 15th.

        <p>Le nombre des juifs vivant au Luxembourg en mai 1940 n’est pas connu avec exactitude. Il est généralement admis qu’en 1940 3.500 à 4.000 personnes de confession israélite vivaient au Luxembourg, des citoyens luxembourgeois, mais aussi un grand nombre de juifs de nationalité étrangère ou apatrides. Environ 3.000 juifs quitteront le Luxembourg entre le 10 mai 1940 et la veille du premier convoi de déportation en Europe de l’Est, le 15 octobre 1941. L’occupation allemande au 10 mai 1940 signifia la fin de l’Etat de droit luxembourgeois. Le Gauleiter du Gau de Coblence‐Trèves, Gustav Simon, fut nommé par décision du Führer chef de l’administration civile pour le territoire luxembourgeois (CdZ) au mois de juillet 1940. Ce fut sous sa responsabilité que les mesures qui allaient bientôt toucher l…</p>

Multimodal digital scholarly publications offer unique affordances over traditional print publishing formats by enabling authors to integrate innovative digital tools and/or data, as well as media-rich enhancements in their scholarly publications. Recent publications taking advantage of such digital affordances have included monographs, enhanced journals, hybrid digital &amp; print projects, as well as podcasts. How are these projects designed and developed to be sustainable, discoverable, and accessible in the long term? Who is publishing them? And how can graduate students and early career scholars acquire the skills and/or find support to develop digital publications? 
This presentation will address how academic publishers are approaching multimodal born-digital and hybrid publications, as well as how libraries are supporting contemporary digital publishing methods. In particular it will introduce the range of recent scholarly digital publications and the University Presses actively seeking proposals. It will also touch on considerations for developing a digital publication, including the DH skill set learning curve, pitching a project to an editor, writing for a public audience, platforms, preservation, and accessibility, and resources for getting started.

        <p>According to the Unesco, “digital heritage consists of unique resources of human knowledge and expression. It embraces cultural, educational, scientific and administrative resources, as well as technical, legal, medical and other  kinds  of  information  created  digitally,  or  converted  into  digital  form  from  existing  analogue  resources. Where resources are “born digital”, there is no other format but the digital object. Digital  materials  include  texts,  databases,  still  and  moving  images,  audio,  graphics,  software  and  web  pages,  among  a  wide  and  growing  range  of  formats.  They  are  frequently  ephemeral,  and  require purposeful production, maintenance, and management to be retained ”.

        <p>Different publics do not simply consume history in museums (as visitors or users) but may also contribute to preserving, producing, and exhibiting history. The symposium will explore questions such as what groups and communities can bring to the production of history in museums and their impact on historical narratives and on the institutions representing them. It will also delve into the limits and challenges of participatory practices and co-production processes in history museums.
What can public participants (not) do? What skills and knowledge are necessary? What are the examples of collaborative decision-making processes that allow contributions from the different publics and how do they affect the role and functioning of museums?

Failure—the real F word if ever there was one—is a topic seldom discussed. If you’ve ever made something, it is likely that you’ve experienced failure. Lots of it. Or, paraphrasing Samuel Beckett, hopefully you have failed better. Over the last decade, game designers John Sharp and Colleen Macklin have interviewed creative practitioners—from chefs to skateboarders, filmmakers to winemakers, and toy designers to comedians to see how they manage the inevitable failures encountered in their practices.

Dieses Buch versteht sich als Einladung zu einer ganz besonderen Entdeckungsreise durch Luxemburgs Süden: Rund vierzig SchriftstellerInnen und HistorikerInnen haben sich von Bruce Springsteens Songs inspirieren lassen und Texte über das luxemburgisch-lothringische Eisenerzbecken, „de Minett“, verfasst, sowie über diejenigen, die dort leben und gelebt haben, die dort geboren oder dorthin eingewandert sind, dort gearbeitet, geliebt, geträumt, gehofft, gekämpft, Erfolg gehabt haben – oder auch gescheitert sind. Indem die Autoren und Autorinnen fiktive, „auf wahren Begebenheiten beruhende“ oder reale Geschichten erzählen, die Geschichten der Helden von „This Hard Minett Land“, „struggling to do everything right“ („Brilliant Disguise“). Begleitet werden die Texte in deutscher, englischer, französischer und luxemburgischer Sprache von Illustrationen des Luxemburger Künstlers Dan Altmann.
Die offizielle Buchpräsentation findet statt am
Dienstag, 15. November 2022 ab 19.00 Uhr
im „Pompelhaus“ in Schifflingen (ehemaliges Gelände der Metzeschmelz), Eingang an der Kreuzung Rue de Lallange/Rue du Moulin
mit musikalischer Einlage von Claudine Muno, die einige Springsteen-Songs singen wird, sowie vom Jazz-Musiker Luciano Pagliarini, die beide auch zu den AutorInnen gehören. Anschließend lädt die Gemeinde Schifflingen zu einem Umtrunk ein.
Um Antwort (im Fall der Teilnahme, ob allein oder in Begleitung) wird gebeten per E-Mail an denis.scuto@uni.lu oder jaspers@capybarabooks.com bis zum 9. November 2022.

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>Mixed Reality, in its many forms, is generally characterised by its audiovisual, spatial and immersive nature, blending virtual content with elements of physical reality into an arrangement that allows users to physically walk through and interact with the resulting three-dimensional hybrid space. Due to these qualities cultural institutions worldwide are experimenting with new ways of communicating, reviving and preserving cultural heritage. The session will show how adapting a body-based design approach that goes beyond the audiovisual can bring about new forms of learning and understanding history.
Katharina Tillmanns is a researcher, designer and lecturer for interactive immersive media at TH Köln (https://colognegamelab.de). A former co-president of the Games for Change Europe network and director of the Notgames Fest, she has been exploring and promoting the expressive qualities of games and other playful media as a means of art and activism for the past 12+ years. Currently Katharina is focusing on her dissertation research, which examines multi-sensory learning in the context of mixed reality environments.

        <p>Un petit pays comme le Luxembourg qui veut développer une recherche de pointe à rayonnement international se voulant en même temps au service du pays se trouve confronté à un problème difficile en ce qui concerne son modèle de gouvernance: d’un côté les moyens forcément limités si on les regarde à l’échelle internationale investis en recherche obligent à faire des choix et à définir des priorités ; d’un autre côté on sait que les percées scientifiques se laissent très difficilement prédire et se font dans des environnements qui laissent une place importante à la prise de risques et aux idées dont l’impact est initialement très incertain. Une discussion sera faite dans quelle mesure la stratégie nationale de la recherche et de l’innovation essaye de trouver des réponses à ce champ de tension.

        <p>Germany’s “Century of Sex” (D. Herzog) offers a case in point for studying gender ambivalences in (post)war contexts. Though gender and sexuality are “useful categories of historical analysis” (Joan W. Scott), they remain profoundly recalcitrant, as they combine liberalisation and repression, consent and violence, the private and the public… As I shall argue, masculinities offer insightful perspectives for understanding German society and Europe at war. Nazism, which advocated an ideal of comradeship and racial purity, regulated gender, sexualities and procreation through racist, homophobic, sexist and eugenic laws. Yet the period also saw the coexistence of sexual constraints and forms of gender violence with the opening of new spaces for sexual and gender experimentation. The Nazi war of…</p>

Text and corpus analysis lie at the heart of digital scholarship in the humanities and social sciences, and a wide range of software tools are available in this domain. These software tools represent prime examples of the ways in which language technologies can support research across a range of disciplines, and they are therefore central to CLARIN’s mission. CLARIN is gathering information and publishing a Resource Family to provide users, both expert and novice, with a free online guide to the discovery and use of these vital tools. The CLARIN Café in September 2022 presented some of the key applications currently in use among research communities, and invited feedback on the Resource Fam…</p>

        <p>Taking the post-conflict context of Northern Ireland as a case study, this lecture will explore some of the challenges of engaging in Public History in a region where the prevailing historical narratives are contested at the most basic level. It will ask to what extent the public use of history plays a part in reinforcing divisions and continuing senses of ‘otherness’. However, it will also look at the important role public history can play in such contexts either as a form of conflict transformation, disrupting dominant narratives and opening up space for dialogue, or as a means of promoting wellbeing and increased senses of belonging among divided and often disadvantaged urban communities.

        <p>Join archivist Lynsey Gillespie (PRONI), access and outreach Officer Bronagh McAtasney (Northern Ireland Screen), and creative producer Laura Aguiar (Nerve Centre) to hear how their organisations have developed forms of creative engagement that puts the public at the heart of archives and helps to democratise access to public history in Northern Ireland. In this public lecture, they will discuss the role of sharing authority in their work and how this has been applied from collecting to cataloguing and public engagement. Drawing on a selection of sample projects, they will demonstrate how they have used participatory methods to help PRONI and Northern Ireland Screen fill gaps within their collections and be more reflective and relevant to a diverse society.

330 Fisher-Bennett Hall 



This talk will read Ben Stiller’s Severance (2021-), and Apple TV+ programming generally in light of Apple’s unique position in the streaming ecosystem. A service provider as well as a device maker, Apple brands its media productions as exactingly as it does its phones, tablets, computers, and watches. As a result, its content is branded in ways that Netflix and HBO Max’s, for example, is not; indeed, Apple’s still relatively small stable of film and TV content expresses the firm’s manufacturing interests in ways that even Sony’s content, say, does not. This talk establishes the coherence of Apple’s TV branding and asks how it should matter to a materialist critical practice. Specifically, it asks if the very coherence of Apple’s trans-corporate branding makes it possible to glimpse in Apple content the otherwise hidden, outsourced, upstream production processes upon which the company still depends.
Michael Szalay is Professor of English at the University of California, Irvine. He teaches 20th- and 21st-century fiction, television, and film, as well as courses on World-Systems Theory and the origins of capitalism. His first two books (Hip Figures: A Literary History of the Democratic Party and New Deal Modernism: American Literature and the Invention of the Welfare State) examine the relationship between literature, liberal governance, and economic crisis. His forthcoming book, Second Lives: Black-Market Melodramas and the Reinvention of Television (Chicago, 2023), defines a new television genre—the black-market melodrama—that has driven the ascent of TV as a cultural force over the last two decades, and that continues to mediate the ongoing effects of deindustrialization on a changing U.S. middle class.

        <p>Insurgent Academics, my new book project, constructs an intellectual history of what I term “academic insurgency,” which links contemporary developments in mobilized, experimental, digital, and public humanities emerging in African diaspora, U.S. ethnic, and postcolonial studies to a longer trajectory of interventions made by scholars of colour within higher education. These “insurgent academics,” I argue,</p>

        <p>Tourné en Lorraine et au Luxembourg, « L‘usine secrète » propose un regard empathique et fort sur la sidérurgie et les mines, en montrant des dessous peu connus de ce monde particulier : l’autonomie, l’humour, la débrouille, la fauche, la bricole, l’alcool, l’entraide. Comment tissait-on des liens entre sidérurgistes ou mineurs ? Comment déjouait-on les surveillances des gardes pour sortir du materiel ? Comment s’arrangeait-on pour « bricoler » sur place des objets qu’on ramenait ensuite à la maison ou dans son jardin ? Comment prenait-on des libertés sur les règlements ? Et qu’est devenue avec le temps cette autonomie ouvrière connue mais peu racontée ? Au final, à quoi servaient ces systèmes de transgression ?
« L’usine secrète » dresse un portrait original et inhabituel du monde ouvrier et de ses évolutions sur 50 ans. Il fait partie de ces rares documentaires sur des sujets sérieux mais traités avec humour et donc pouvant aussi s’adresser « aux jeunes »… Car l’autonomie dans le travail est un thème universel.

        <p>Border studies is an interdisciplinary field of research in which existing scholarship has primarily been spatially oriented. The conference Borders In Flux and Border Temporalities In and Beyond Europe sheds light on research that focuses on the temporality of borders. The conference connects leading researchers as well as established and early-stage researchers to present, share and discuss their research on borders, borderlands, and border regions in and beyond 19th and 20th century Europe.
The conference invites scholars whose research sheds light on the temporal dimension of borders by exploring border practices, border discourses, and analyses of border regimes and life at the border in Europe.

        <p>This dataset includes derived data on a collection of ca. 2,700 books in English published between 2001–2021 and spanning 12 different genres. The data was manually collected to capture popular writing aimed at a range of different readerships across fiction (1,934) and non-fiction (820). Genres include forms of cultural capital (bestsellers, prizewinners, elite book reviews), stylistic affinity (mysteries, science fiction, biography, etc.), and age-level (middle-grade and young adult). The dataset allows researchers to explore the effects of audience, genre, and instrumentality (i.e., fictionality) on the stylistic behavior of authors within the recent past across different classes of professionally published writing.

Publication of Cather’s correspondence nearly complete 



The digitization, transcription and annotation of all of Willa Cather’s known letters is nearly finished. More than 2,600 of the 3,200 pieces of correspondence have been published online through the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Willa Cather Archive.
The feat has spanned nearly a decade, with the first letters published in book form, “The Selected Letters of Willa Cather,” in 2013, after the moratorium on their publication was lifted in 2011. The digital humanities project “The Complete Letters of Willa Cather” followed close behind.
Andrew Jewell, project director and co-editor for “The Complete Letters of Willa Cather,” said the remaining letters are in the pipeline for publication and he expects the work t…</p>

        <p>Rapid-response digital archives have emerged as a standard way digital humanities teams document community in time of crisis. Their strength lies in building connections to communities and collecting materials that will be critical to future generations of scholars. In documenting the pandemic (2020-22) A Journal of a Plague Year: An Archive of Covid-19 challenged the traditional approach to curating rapid-response archives seeking by assigning robust metadata to objects as they entered the archive. This archival metadata included curatorial tags, contributor tags, and in some cases community-assigned tags. This talk discusses that effort, including the strengths and limitations of crowd-based curation; it will include a meditation on how such efforts at crowd curation might enhance the accessibility of rapid response archives, especially archives of the pandemic

        <p>In this paper we present the first-ever procedure for identifying highly similar sequences of text in Chinese and Tibetan translations of Buddhist sūtra literature. We initially propose this procedure as an aid to scholars engaged in the philological study of Buddhist documents. We create a cross-lingual embedding space by taking the cosine similarity of average sequence vectors in order to produce unsupervised similar cross-linguistic parallel alignments at word, sentence, and even paragraph level. Initial results show that our method lays a solid foundation for the future development of a fully-fledged Information Retrieval tool for these (and potentially other) low-resource historical languages.

Dr Nan Bernstein Ratner talks about her latest project CLASP (Child Language ASessment Project), which makes use of datasets at the CLARIN Knowledge Centre TalkBank. The project hopes to provide a stronger evidence base for child language assessment, which will improve future research, as well as support clinicians in mapping out the most effective treatments for children with language disorders.
Bernstein Ratner also discusses how spoken language data is increasingly being used by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) industry in order to train voice assistants to recognise speech by people who stutter.

        <p>Scholars from across disciplinary boundaries have attempted to crack the code of videogame history and preservation for the last decade. Yet, much of what is published on these topics is still dominated by journalistic accounts. As such, game scholars and historians should build bridges and collaborate. This presentation will give an overview of videogame history and preservation, the field game studies, and an oral history methodology tailored specifically to videogames. 
The following day, our guest speaker will conduct a workshop to provide a hands-on demonstration of the research methodology illustrated by his talk.

        <p>The presentation shows the results of Anna Bączkowska&#x27;s research conducted at the University in Luxembourg over the last three months. It focuses on the analysis of immigration discourse retrieved from social media created by Polish immigrants to Luxembourg. The analysis is based on the polska.lu forum which spans the last 15 years. The data were extracted both manually and automatically; thus, three subcorpora were created. The language used by forum interactants was investigated with the aid of corpus linguistics tools in order to notice some trends and tendencies in lexical choices of the forum users as well as the prevailing topics.

        <p>Project Start Date: 

September, 2020



This project investigates the role of translation in nineteenth-century Russian literature’s rise to prominence in world literature as a case study in the processes whereby a nationally or linguistically defined literature may achieve circulation and recognition on a global level. We seek to understand the ways in which the canon of Russian literature was conceptualized and composed differently in different translated contexts; to query Pascale Casanova’s claim that Paris was the most important “capital” of the “World Republic of Letters”; and to determine which other locales played a significant role in the process of a “peripheral” literature’s incorporation into “world literature” in the space of less than a century.
19C RLT currently tracks book publications of works by Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky into English, French, and German from the death of Pushkin in 1837 to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, comprising a growing database as well as maps, graphs, and other visualizations of the data. Future phases are planned to add more authors and expand the scope to include other global contexts in which Russian literature became an important translated literature in the twentieth century and beyond.

          Reading time: 1 minutes </p>
        <p>The Trove Newspaper Harvester has been around in different forms for more than a decade. It helps you download all the articles in a Trove newspaper search, opening up new possibilities for large-scale analysis. You can use it as a command-line tool by installing a Python package, or through the Trove Newspaper Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench.
I’ve just overhauled development of the Python package. The new trove-newspaper-harvester replaces the old troveharvester repository. The command-line interface remains the same (with a few new options), so it’s really a drop in replacement. Read the full documentation of the new package for more details.

Here’s a summary of the changes:
the package can now be used as a library (that you incorporate into your own code) as well as a standalone command-line tool – this means you can embed the harvester in your own tools or workflows
both the library and the CLI now let you set the names of the directories in which your harvests will be saved – this makes it easier to organise your harvests into groups and give them meaningful names
the harvesting process now saves results into a newline-delimited JSON file (one JSON object per line) – the library has a save_csv() option to convert this to a CSV file, while the CLI automatically converts the results to CSV to maintain compatibility with previous versions
behind the scenes, the package is now developed and maintained using nbdev – this means the code and documentation are all generated from a set of Jupyter notebooks
the Jupyter notebooks include a variety of automatic tests which should make maintenance and development much easier in the future
I’ve also updated the Trove Newspaper Harvester section of the GLAM Workbench to use the new package. The new core library will make it easier to develop more complex harvesting examples – for example, searching for articles from a specific day across a range of years. If you find any problems, or want to suggest improvements, please raise an issue.</p>

        <p>In this post, we reach back in time to showcase an older project and highlight its impact on data visualization in Digital Humanities as well as its good practices to make different layers of scholarship available for increased transparency and reusability.  

Developed at Stanford with other research partners (&#x27;Cultures of Knowledge&#x27; at Oxford, the Groupe d&#x27;Alembert at CNRS, the KKCC-Circulation of Knowledge and Learned Practices in the 17th-century Dutch Republic, the DensityDesign ResearchLab), the &#x27;Mapping of the Republic of Letters Project&#x27; aimed at digitizing and visualizing the intellectual community throughout the XVI and XVIII centuries known as &#x27;Republic of Letters&#x27; (an overview of the concept can be found in Bots and Waquet, 1997), to get a better sense of the shape, size and associated intellectual network, its inherent complexities and  boundaries.

Below  we highlight the different, interrelated
layers of making project outputs available and reusable on the long term (way before FAIR data became a widespread policy imperative!): methodological reflections, interactive visualizations, the associated data and its data model schema. All of these layers are published in a trusted repository and are interlinked with each other via their Persistent Identifiers.

        <p>A few weeks ago I created a new search interface to the NSW Post Office Directories from 1886 to 1908. Since then, I’ve used the same process on the Sydney Telephone Directories from 1926 to 1954. Both of these publications had been digitised by the State Library of NSW and made available through Trove. To build the new interfaces I downloaded the text from Trove, indexed it by line, and linked it back to the online page images.
But there are similar directories from other states that are not available through Trove. The Tasmanian Post Office Directory, for example, has been digitised between 1890 and 1948 and made available as 48 individual PDF files from Libraries Tasmania. While it’s great that they’ve been digitised, it’s not really possible to search them without downloading all the P…</p>

        <p>FHA Credit, Redlining, and Rental Housing in Metropolitan America


Project Start Date: 

September, 2022



“Mortgaging Out” is a digital history project that illuminates the  impact of Federal Housing Administration credit policies  on the availability of affordable rental housing during and immediately following World War II. Scholars have illuminated the impact of redlining on  mortgage lending, demonstrating how African American homebuyers, in particular, were often locked out of the midcentury housing boom. This project shifts the focus to FHA-insured apartment complexes. Drawing upon  a comprehensive data set FHA mortgage insurance data that catalogues more than 50,000 FHA-insured apartment buildings, the project maps the location, size (by unit count), and construction dates of roughly 7,000 projects constructed under the FHA wartime housing program (Section 608, 1942-1950). Future versions of the map may include FHA-backed market-rate multifamily housing (Section 207) as well as multifamily rental projects on urban renewal sites (Section 220) and for those displaced from urban renewal sites (Section 221).

        <p>In this presentation, Frédéric Calvert will talk about the COST action SlowMemo. At the core of this project lays the emergent concept of &#x27;slow memory&#x27;, that is intended to help us think from new angles about how societies and individuals remember the pasts that meaningfully affect their present and future. It begins from the premise that we are quite skilled (and have much practice) commemorating sudden or extreme events such as wars, atrocities or catastrophes. But we are less certain about how to reckon with slow-moving transformations that may be just as impactful, such as climate change, deindustrialization, or the gradual expansion of social and political rights.

I’m currently co-editing a special issue on Digital tools for the Journal of Digital History, which provides an innovative and multi-layered publication platform via Jupyter Notebooks. Full cfp can be found here.
The special issue welcomes contributions that introduce and discuss digital toolkits for exploring historic source materials, be they sonic, textual, visual, or audiovisual. We seek to collect a broad range of publications that demonstrate and critically analyse new ways of exploring the past through computational means and strive to open up and problematize the use of digital methods in historic research.

The CLARIN and Libraries workshop took place at KB National Library of the Netherlands on 9 and 10 May 2022. This was the first workshop with the explicit aim of bringing together the CLARIN community across Europe and research libraries to discuss issues relating to the delivery of digital content for researchers, and to plan practical steps for future collaboration. 
There were 30 participants in the workshop, the majority with library-based roles, from 15 different European countries, which led to a stimulating and fruitful discussion. Participants were able to reflect on a number of major library initiatives (past, present and future) involving the delivery of textual content from large text collections. These projects, usua…</p>

        <p>I’ve updated the GLAM Workbench’s harvest of OCRd text from Trove’s digitised periodicals. This is a completely fresh harvest, so should include any corrections made in recent months. It includes:
1,430 periodicals
OCRd text from 41,645 issues
About 9gb of text
The easiest way to explore the harvest is probably this human-readable list. The list of periodicals with OCRd text is also available as a CSV. You can find more details in the Trove journals section of the GLAM Workbench, and download the complete corpus from CloudStor.
Finding which periodical issues in Trove have OCRd text you can download is not as easy as it should be. The fullTextInd index doesn’t seem to distinguish between digitised works (with OCR)  and born-digital publications (like PDFs) without downloadable text. You ca…</p>

        <p>The digital representation and publishing of human history on the web has so far been stuck at the digital unlocking of collections of historical items. Those collections are described by metadata mostly for curation and for findability metadata that are put on the web in the manner of a library catalog. Usually, there is little on ‘aboutness’. This is unfortunate, as modern representations of knowledge and web-based interactive presentation techniques offer ample opportunities for a more complex representation and richer interaction with digital history. In this contribution, we argue for a history in digital data that is treated for what it is: an interpretation, like all history, while remaining traceable to its information carriers.

        <p>As part of my work on the Everyday Heritage project I’m looking at how we can make better use of digitised collections to explore the everyday experiences woven around places such as Parramatta Road in Sydney. For example, the NSW Postal Directories from 1886 to 1908 and 1909 to 1950 have been digitised by the State Library of NSW and made available through Trove.  The directories list residences and businesses by name and street location. Using them we can explore changes in the use of Parramatta Road across 60 years of history. But there’s a problem. While you can browse the directories page by page, searching is clunky. Trove’s main search indexes the contents of the directories by ‘article’. Each ‘article’ can be many pages long, so it’s difficult to focus in on the matching text. Clic…</p>

The violation of a country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty – an act in clear breach of the United Nations Charter – has shattered the shared framework of values and principles fostered by multilateralism after the Second World War in the hope of achieving world peace, while leading to an unprecedented outpouring of solidarity for Ukraine and the plight of its people from Western democracies and European and international organisations, including NATO, the UN, the European Union and the Council of Europe, and their Member States and…</p>

        <p>Drama Critiques’ dataset was produced as part of Mylène Maignant’s PhD project at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (Ulm) between 2018 and 2022. Her research aims to explore the reception of contemporary London theatre (2010 to 2020) by analysing a large corpus based on the reviews written by two distinct groups of theatre critics: the journalistic one on the one hand, and the digital one on the other hand (bloggers). By relying partly on the data made available by Theatre Record (https://www.theatrerecord.com/) and by automatically extracting the content of 28 blogs, we built a corpus constituting more than 40,000 theatre reviews. Only 36,000 are open access, as some of the bloggers have not given their authorisation yet. The purpose of this data collection consisted of exploring the similarities and differences between these two literary communities. We were interested in better understanding the cultural discourse both journalists and bloggers construct. Given the amount of data, we relied on digital technologies to investigate this field. Using various digital techniques, such as computational linguistics, sentiment analysis, and Geographic Information Systems, we conducted a number of different analyses to map this cultural phenomenon. If some publications have already tackled the literary theme of English digital theatre criticism, none of them have examined it from a computational perspective. Drama Critiques’ dataset is then the first corpus which not only offers so many contemporary reviews based on journalists and bloggers’ publications, but which also proposes a study of its content (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6799656).

Submission deadline: September 5, 2022
In recent years, digital publishing has increasingly acquired relevance in the Humanities. This is particularly the case for critical editions, which, notably when compared to print editions, can now profit from the flexibility of XML with TEI tag suite, full-text or faceted search functionalities, semantic annotations, named entity recognition and continuous improvement.
The use of cognitive computing techniques based on Artificial Intelligence for e.g. machine learning-based classification and natural language processing, is making the transcription of sources and ann…</p>

End-term Conference
The DLA Marbach (German Literature Archive Marbach), the Klassik Stiftung Weimar and the Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel are home to over 500 years of German and European cultural history. In 2013, these institutions joined forces to form the MWW Research Association, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. From the start, the MWW has been involved in digital collection research and since 2019, there has been a focus on the targeted development of needs-oriented digital services and model solutions.
After ten years of successful cooperation, in February 2024, the association will conclude its second phase of funding. The MWW will use this milestone as an opportunity…</p>

Punk Cubano is the first digital archive dedicated to Cuban punk culture. Published in Spanish in 2020, the site gives access to the music production of 26 Cuban bands, as well as to several short testimonials about the experience of being punk in the island. This archive serves a double purpose: to work as a tool for Cuban musicians to publish their music, and to make information about Cuban punk accessible to anyone with an interest in it. 
The site was curated and published by Dr. Carmen Torre Perez, with permission from the featured bands/individuals, and the pictures and video testimonials were taken/recorded by Samuel Reina Calvo.
 
Dr. Perez graduated from the Hispanic Studies program at Penn in 2022 and is currently lecuturer at Boston University.

A decade after its founding, New Orleans was home to at least 37 women who had been deported from France in 1719. Most of them had been unjustly pronounced guilty of prostitution. This interactive map makes it possible to learn who they really were and where they lived in New Orleans.

National Epics will run from Albania and Algeria to Vietnam and Wales, an alphabetical organization that reproduces the sovereign, Olympian starkness of nationalism. Each National Epics author also contributes to nationalepics.com, initially by briefly discussing how a designated territorial space shapes or is shaped by &quot;epical&quot; texts that tell its story to the world. Collectively and cumulatively, we will help augment the emergent disciplinary field known as critical nationalism studies.
Nationalepics.com is developing in parallel with National Epics, a collaborative work of c. 83 or 84 chapters, to be published by Oxford University Press (UK) and edited by David Wallace. While National Epics suggests a stabilized outcome, a multi-volume book with reference value, nationalepics.com evokes the process of getting there, acknowledging that the nature and dynamics of nationalism, and the texts that serve or subvert it, never rest. And while most such large-scale projects develop behind closed doors, nationalepics.com aims to share resources and air critical issues along the way.

        <p>Detecting Genre in Pitchfork Reviews


Project Start Date: 

August, 2021



We analyze 23,000 reviews from Pitchfork.com to establish a network of over 7,000 artists based on their co-presence in reviews. We use Gephi&#x27;s (Louvain community detection) modularity class feature to sort the network into closely connected groups. However, because this process is non-deterministic, we improve on its results by running it 10,000 times. Using this novel &quot;metamodularity&quot; method we can show how often any two artists were sorted into the same group. For instance, the jazz musician Alice Coltrane was grouped with John Coltrane 10,000 times, with Sly and the Family Stone 4,939 times, and with Guns n’ Roses one time. With these data, we can visualize how the largely undifferentiated mass of artists fragments into more and more connected groups could be described as genres. 
While some of the genres suggested by this method are incredibly specific, one notable exception is the group of African American musicians, which is remarkably large and stable. The artists within it range from Flying Lotus to Motown legend Marvin Gaye to trap rapper Young Thug to R&amp;B singer-songwriter Sade to gangster rapper Tupac Shakur to funk innovators Funkadelic to cross-over hip hop star Cardi B. This is a far more capacious group than most rock clusters along aesthetic, market, and even historic grounds. This may reflect real world connections, yet it is also possible that this metamodularity difference reflects a bias at Pitchfork, where a (historically) rock-oriented hipster aesthetic and a (historically) largely white male audience may correspond to a relative lack of nuance when covering Black artists (historically). In any case, it is fair to say based on these data that Pitchfork has written about Black artists in a structurally unique way over the years relative to their coverage of white artists.

I’m very excited to announce that the British Library is now sponsoring the web archives section! Many thanks to the British Library and the UK Web Archive for their support – it really makes a difference.
The web archives section was developed in 2020 with the support of the International Internet Preservation Consortium’s Discretionary Funding Programme, in collaboration with the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand. It’s intended to help historians, and other researchers, understand what sort of data is available through web archives, how to get it,  and what you can do with it. It provides a series of tools and examples that document existing AP…</p>

        <p>There’s lots of GLAM data out there if you know where to look! For the past few years I’ve been harvesting a list of datasets published by Australian galleries, libraries, archives, and museums through open government data portals. I’ve just updated the harvest and there’s now 463 datasets containing 1,192 files. There’s a human-readable version of the list that you can browse. If you just want the data you can download it as a CSV. Or if you’d like to search the list there’s a database version hosted on Glitch. The harvesting and processing code is available in this notebook.
The GLAM data from government portals section of the GLAM Workbench provides more information and a summary of results.  For example, here’s a list of the number of data files by GLAM institution.

        <p>The HistorESCH project is a collaboration between Nuit de la Culture and the PHACS-team of public historians at the University of Luxembourg to tell the history of the city through the personal memories and objects of the Escher community.
HistorESCH: Escher Geschichten a 25 Objeten erzielt is an exhibition that will celebrate a year of engagement with the Escher community. The first phase of this project involved community workshops and crowdsourcing to collect photographs of potential objects to present at this exhibition. The second phase consisted of the categorisation of these objects by our Citizen Historian Circle (CHiC) and an online vote to select the objects for the exhibition.
The everyday objects bear witness to a personal approach to history. They tell the story of workers, sportsmen, or the distant past of the city. The free exhibition will showcase 25 of the most popular objects in the Pop-Up store in the shopping street of Esch-sur-Alzette. Each visitor will receive an exhibition catalogue in their preferred language (French, Luxembourgish or English) to read the personal anecdote and historical context of the object.
 
Opening hours
2 – 24 September, Monday – Saturday from 13.00-18.00.
Free entrance.
Location
Pop-Up Store, 121 Rue de l&#x27;Alzette, 4011 Esch-sur-Alzette

        <p>The conference is organised by the C²DH within the context of the project &quot;Doing Experimental Media Archaeology: Practice &amp; Theory&quot; (DEMA), funded by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR).
There has been a growing interest in the use of experimental approaches to the study of media histories and their cultures. An increasing number of scholars researching at the intersection of media history and theory are breaking new ground while working with archival sources and artefacts in experimental ways, e.g. through historical re-enactments and hands-on simulations. In their 2014 essay “Experimental Media Archaeology: A Plea for New Directions”, Andreas Fickers and Annie van den Oever underline the heuristic potential of hands-on approaches for re-sensitising scholars to the materiality of …</p>

        <p>I’ve made a small change to the Zotero translator for the National Library of Australia’s catalogue. Now, if there’s a link to a digitised version of the work in Trove, that link will be saved in Zotero’s url field. This makes it quicker and easier to view digitised items – just click on the ‘URL’ label in Zotero to open the link.
It’s also handy if you’re viewing a digitised work in Trove and want to capture the metadata about it. Just click on the ‘View catalogue’ link in the details tab of a Trove item, then use Zotero to save the details from the catalogue.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve created a new dataset containing 10 years of data that can be used to explore the workings of the National Archives of Australia’s access examination system.

Australian government records become available for public access after 20 years. But before being opened to the public, records go through a  process known as access examination to determine whether they should be withheld, either partially or completely. The grounds for exemption are laid out in the Archives Act and include things like national security and personal privacy. If a record is completely withheld from access, the NAA’s database, RecordSearch, records its access status as ‘closed’.
On or about 1 January every year since 2016, I’ve harvested details of files in RecordSearch with the access status of ‘closed’. On the day when the media is full of revelations from the public release of the latest batch of cabinet records, I thought it was important to find out what we couldn’t see, as well as what we could. I’ve now published all the annual harvests as a dataset on Zenodo.
It’s important to note that records can be re-examined and their access status can change. Also some ‘closed’ files are actually ‘withheld  pending advice’ – in these cases a final access decision hasn’t been made as the NAA has referred the files to their controlling agencies for advice. This means that this dataset should be treated as providing annual snapshots of an active system, not a cumulative record of closed files. Some of the complexities of the access examination system revealed by this data are discussed in the Inside Story article ‘Withheld pending advice’. I’m hoping to do some more analysis later this year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Computational Humanities Research Community,
As many of you know, we have been publishing our conference proceedings with CEUR Workshop Proceedings since the first edition of CHR back in 2020. CEUR has provided an accessible and open platform to share our work. However, our conference’s growth has led CEUR to inform us that they are no longer able to publish our proceedings, also considering that we’re not a computer science conference.
This presents both a challenge and an opportunity for us. We need to identify a new, sustainable solution that aligns with our values as a community: openness, accessibility, and inclusivity. We are committed to ensuring that the process of selecting a new venue is as participatory and transparent as possible, which is why we are reaching out to all of you for suggestions, ideas, and feedback.
Here are some points to consider when proposing or evaluating alternatives:
We want to continue using TeX
How can we ensure that our proceedings remain freely accessible to researchers worldwide?
What are the long-term implications in terms of costs, maintenance, and scalability?
Does the venue reflect the interdisciplinary nature of our work, particularly the balance between computational methods and humanities research?
If you have suggestions, please share them in the comments below.
We look forward to hearing your ideas!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humming Home is a FNR-funded series of events that aim to look at how different cultures, community groups, and people use sound, music, and silence to talk about their history.
What can music and history have in common? Can the sound tell us more about the past? What role does the voice have in this? And what about silence? Does it also speak? And does voice imply agency over history? How are sounds and their absence reflected in our political and cultural recollection of the past?
On Listening with Politics:
In 2023, Abu Hamdan founded Earshot, the world’s first organization using sound for the defense of human and environmental rights. Reflecting on its first year of operation, Abu Hamdan will be elaborating on the interrelations of art and activism and listening with politics. The pres…]]></summary>

I worked on the first phase of the Community Data Lab, developing the Trove Data Guide amongst other things. I’m very keen to see the CDL expand, working with researchers to create new possibilities for digital research, particularly using the rich collections of the GLAM sector (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2024, the National Archives of Australia digitised 254,953 files (down from 416,602 in 2023). This chart shows the number of files digitised per day in 2024.
The decrease in the total number of files digitised is probably related to the completion of the NAA’s five year project to digitise Second World War service records. Thanks to $10 million in government funding, the NAA has digitised more than a million service records since 2019. In 2023, 81% of records digitised were from series containing service records. This has dropped to around 40% in 2024. Here’s the total number of files digitised per year since February 2021.
The files digitised in 2024 came from 1,439 different series. Here’s the top twenty series by number of items digitised in 2024. You’ll see that as well as war recor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are countless days every year with internationalist and universal pretentions, what sets May Day apart is its success. May Day’s global impact and cross-cultural participation, often in spite of local elites, sets it further apart from its would-be competitors. It has been—and still is—celebrated by Anarchists in Tunisia, Socialists in Argentina, and Communists in India because these groups, despite all their differences, share a common international and socialist culture. May Day’s importance in this culture makes the question of who “made” it so relevant; who is responsible for this shared socialist symbol? Based on early research into the spread of May Day, this presentation sets the stakes of the debate over the origins and spread of May Day and traces the competing global and national narratives of the day’s early history. Tracing these narratives alongside the spread of May Day across the globe shows how interwoven the cultural worlds of international socialists are and explains why the day has succeeded in becoming one the great symbols of the struggle for social justice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Legacy of ‘The Family of Man’ project, funded by the Luxembourg National Research Fund, aims to shed new light on the reception of Edward Steichen’s photographic exhibition in the context of its international tour and of the permanent exhibition in Luxembourg.
Having toured the world during the Cold War, the impression became a tool of cultural diplomacy for the US Information Agency. However, very little research has been done on the reception of the exhibition and how the latter was adapted for the different locations. Here, the project will focus on the Global South. Concerning the local exhibition, the reception has been assessed; however, it has not been assessed in a historical-critical manner.
Initially neglected by the Luxembourg authorities, ‘The Family of Man’ underwent a nation-branding during the 1990s, and this trend has continued. Using oral history methods and a visitor survey, the research project aims for a more diverse and critical perspective on the exhibition. Ultimately, the project will draw on public history approaches for the publication of results: a website with an interactive map and a comic book are in the planning.
 
Speaker
Dr Claude Ewert is a historian specialising in contemporary Europe, with a focus on Cold War and European integration history. He obtained his PhD from the University of Cambridge, where he wrote his dissertation titled ‘The European Community’s Relations with the Soviet Union (1973-1991).’
Following a brief stint in EU diplomacy, Claude joined the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History as a postdoctoral researcher in the FOMLeg project.

6,241,739 digitised newspaper articles were added to Trove in 2024. The  rate of digitisation was pretty quick until the end of March when the  processing of the Melbourne Sun ended, then things flattened out a bit.

While the number of articles with corrections, tags, and comments all  increased steadily across 2024, there seems to have been a bit of glitch indexing tags and comments causing some jumps in the totals.

Most of the digitised newspaper articles were published in NSW (3,190,972), Victoria (2,680,855), and South Australia (363,483).

Recent research has focused on the emergence of new professionals who are willing and able to work across national frontiers.

Luxembourgish presence in Romania (1890-1950)”, the C²DH and the Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations humaines, Dudelange, organise a symposium regarding Jewish migration from eastern Austria-Hungary and Romania to Luxembourg and vice versa, within the broader context of antisemitism in Russian-occupied Bukovina during the First World War, and in Romania in the first half of the 20th century. Two Romania-based specialists, Andrei Cușco and Bronwyn Cragg, will dive into the history of antisemitic discourse and violence, a driving force behind the emigration of Jews, as well as a Luxembourgish Jew’s first-hand experience of antisemitism in Romania, while Philippe Blasen from the C²DH/CDMH will retrace the migration of Jews from Romania to Luxembourg during the interwar period.

Please introduce yourself. What is your background?
After graduating in Philosophy, I started my career at the University of Pisa with a national ministerial grant in computational linguistics, a completely new field to me. I liked it a lot.

Apostolos Spanos is a professor of History at the University of Agder in Norway. His research and teaching are based on interdisciplinary approaches to history as a discipline and to historical evolution as a phenomenon. His interests lie in historical consciousness, the coinherence of historical times, modeling history, the use of AI in studying and teaching history, the use of games to study the past, and the study of innovation as a mode of historical existence and evolution. He has recently published the book Games of History: Games and Gaming as Historical Sources.

CLARIN and SADiLaR are happy to endorse the LT4All 2025 conference, which will be held from February 24 to 26, 2025, at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris. 
This event, organized by ELRA, SIGUL, and UNESCO within the framework of the International Decade of Indigenous Languages (IDIL), highlights the need for inclusive language technologies, building on the first LT4All conference in 2019. LT4All 2.0 will bring together leaders in language technology to explore ways to advance linguistic diversity and multilingual accessibility, empowering communities. The conference will feature three thematic tracks over three days: Achievements, Challenges, and Solutions, focusing not only on the development of language technologies but also on broader benefits for the community. Each day includes keynote sessions, panels, and poster presentations, fostering dialogue on the ethical, technical, and policy challenges of inclusive language technology development.
Expressions of interest in participating in the programme are still open. For more details, please visit LT4All 2025.

Written by Darja Fišer
2024 was another successful year for CLARIN! We welcomed new members (Spain and South Africa), increased the number of service and knowledge centres (now a total of 73), and worked hard to achieve two of our key strategic goals: improving interoperability and findability.
 
A new CLARIN Resource Family was developed for Corpora of Disordered Speech. It deals with a specific kind of speech data that is related to the recordings of individuals with communication disorders. These corpora are invaluable for education and research, but are costly and hard to build and can be difficult to share, given privacy and confidentiality issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humming Home est une série d’événements qui visent à examiner comment différentes cultures, groupes communautaires et individus utilisent le son, la musique et le silence pour parler de leur histoire. Qu’ont en commun la musique et l’histoire ? Le son peut-il nous en dire plus sur le passé ? Quel rôle joue la voix dans ce contexte ? Et le silence ? Parle-t-il aussi ? La voix implique-t-elle une certaine maîtrise de l’histoire ? Comment les sons et leur absence se reflètent-ils dans notre mémoire politique et culturelle du passé ?
La série «Humming Home» démarre avec un concert de jazz en direct et une discussion avec le compositeur et musicien palestinien Mohamed Najem, du Mohammed Najem Quartet, le 16 janvier 2025.

But with the imminent closure of the botsin.space Mastodon instance, I’ve had to find it a new home. Say hello to the latest version: @trovenewsbot@wraggebots.net!

Instead of just moving the bot to an existing instance, I decided to set up my own using GoToSocial. I thought this would give me more control, and encourage me to resurrect some more of my old Twitter bots. I installed GoToSocial on the smallest available DigitalOcean droplet, following the ‘bare metal’ instructions.

Written by Jurgita Vaičenonienė
Welcome to CLARIN-LT! In 2024, we are celebrating our 10-year anniversary – Lithuania became a full member of CLARIN ERIC on October 25, 2014, and a year later, a consortium of three partners was established. At present, the consortium includes six full partners: Vytautas Magnus University (coordinating institution), Kaunas Technology University, Vilnius University, and the newer consortium members Mykolas Romeris University, Baltic Institute of Advanced Technologies, and the Institute of Baltic Region History and Archaeology. Although the composition of our team members has changed over time, we have always been an interdisciplinary and international consortium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Political violence is defined as the deliberate use of power and force to achieve political goals. It is characterized by both physical and psychological acts aimed at injuring or intimidating populations. In that sense, the word "difficult" in the title of this seminar refers to events in time that can be identified as acts of political violence.
In such circumstances, any attempt to do public history can certainly have its challenges. From ensuring participation, to working with silence, considering the mental health of both the participants and the project leaders, or anticipating the social impact before making this research public. 
During this seminar, Myriam Dalal will expand on the definition of the relatively new field of artistic research methodologies, which involves the creation of arts to help the practitioner/researcher improve, change or make their processes more effective, specific and articulated.
Myriam Dalal will then discuss how artistic research methodologies can work with and help address some of the challenges of documenting “difficult” histories, based on examples from her research projects (1) tackling war, its photographic representation in the case of Lebanon and (2) migration/exile and the displacement/belonging experience in Luxembourg.

The CLARIN Knowledge Centre for Swedish in a Multilingual Setting (CLARIN-SMS) is primarily directed at researchers in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and beyond with a need for analysis, annotation or data mining of Swedish or multilingual texts, and of Swedish Sign Language.
CLARIN-SMS makes resources in the form of tools for linguistic processing, as well as corpora available for research in the Humanities and Social Sciences. The resources include monolingual (mainly Swedish) and multilingual corpora across several domains, and tools for the basic processing of text, including tokenisation, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and named entity recognition.

        <link href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2024/11/21/six-more-volumes.html"/>
        <updated>2024-11-21T05:05:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of months ago I realised my big, searchable database of Tasmanian Post Office Directories was missing the volume from 1920. It took a bit of work to add it in, as described in this post. Unfortunately, I’d barely finished when I realised that a number of other years were also missing! Argh! The good news is that I’ve been steadily working through these missing volumes, adding one a week, and now I’m finally, finally finished!

The new volumes are:
1920
1933-34
1941-42
1942-43
1943-44
1945-46
In total there are now 54 volumes from 1890 to 1948. Every line of every volume has been OCRd and indexed, so you can run fulltext searches across all 54 volumes to find matching entries. The fulltext search also supports advanced operators like wildcards and booleans.
As I mentioned in relation to 1920, while these volumes can be downloaded as PDFs from Libraries Tasmania, they don’t contain any OCRd text – they’re not searchable (despite what Libraries Tasmania says here). The quality of the scans is also quite variable – tight bindings cut off text, pages are skewed, and lighting is inconsistent. This means that the OCR processing is far from perfect. There will be names missing from the search index as a result of this. However, because you can search across all volumes at once, the database makes it easier to find people, as you can pick them up in one year and follow them through subsequent volumes, filling in any gaps.
It would be great if Libraries Tasmania would add a link to the database from their Directories and almanacs page. I’ve sent a couple of emails but haven’t received a reply. It seems odd that they’d link to commercial offerings like FindMyPast, but not to the free, community-developed version!]]></summary>

Written by Harald Lüngen
With my CLARIN mobility grant, I visited CSC, the Finnish IT Centre for Science in Espoo, Finland, which hosts the Finnish corpus archive Kielipankki that is part of FIN-CLARIN.

My official stay according to the grant was from 29 August until 6 September 2024, but I got the opportunity by my employer to stay a bit longer at CSC, and I had planned the scope of my project for the extended stay. In my project, I wanted to prepare a subcorpus from the Kielipankki archives for the European Reference Corpus initiative EuReCo, and also to try and set up a KorAP instance for EuReCo at CSC.

EuReCo is an initiative that aims to create (pairs of) comparable corpora by making existing corpora maintained …]]></summary>

Luxemb(o)urg in the Second World War is an online exhibition developed by the C²DH of the University of Luxembourg based on a 2021 convention with the Ministry of State. The aim of the exhibition is to present the history of Luxembourg during the Second World War, taking account of recent historical research. To this end, it relies on the advantages of the digital format. The exhibition makes it possible to approach the experiences of Luxembourgers from different perspectives by drawing on rich and often unknown documentation.
Between ‘Luxembourg’ and ‘Luxemburg’, the population faced the Germanisation efforts of the Nazi regime. The period of annexation shows a torn society whose first concern was to cope with everyday life in an exceptional situation. The online exhibition is int…]]></summary>

To do so, he will first explore the current historiography and origin myths of digital history while advocating for greater consideration of disciplinary differences in histories of the digital humanities.
In the second part, he discusses how we might frame a history of digital history. If an imagined “collective” memory exists, the history of digital history started in the 1960s in the United States and Western Europe, involved mostly digital electronic computing employed to support quantitative approaches, and occurred within national silos.

This talk, which is based on a co-authored article with David Canning (Cabinet Office), does not only describe a radically new methodology to appraise digital records, it also makes a significant theoretical …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The SNF (Swiss National Science Foundation) project ‘Horror – Game – Politics’ analysed a sample of 22 digital horror games in terms of their history of ideas. Project manager Eugen Pfister’s aim was to prove that digital games in general, and digital horror games in particular, frequently communicate discursive political statements. This happens both consciously, when developers intend to communicate a specific statement, and unconsciously in the form of myths as described by Roland Barthes. There has long been a consensus in research that a history of ideas and political history cannot be reconstructed solely on the basis of individual political texts. In democratic societies in particular, political communication takes place not only in parliaments and political essays, but also to a large extent in popular culture.
Dott. Ric. Dr. phil. Eugen Pfister is historian and political scientist. In particular, he researches the history of ideas and political history in digital games. He is currently leading the SNF-Sinergia project, ‘Swiss History of Games, Play and Game Design 1968-2000,’ with a team of 20 colleagues at four Swiss universities. Previously, he led the SNSF project ‘Horror-Game-Politics’ at the Bern University of the Arts. He studied at the Universität Wien and the Université Paris IV – Sorbonne. He wrote his PhD in the history of political communication in co-tutelle at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität Frankfurt am Main and the Università degli Studi di Trento. In 2015, he and 15 colleagues founded the Working Group for History and Digital Games (AKGWDS), which has since grown to over 300 members.

The participants are all creators of historical comics and webcomics. The purpose of the webinar is for us to share our experiences, but not only that - we are also endeavouring to develop ‘history and webcomics’ as a field of study in its own right. By bringing the participants together, we hope to encourage collaboration between creator-historians and (academic) public historians. This event is unique in that it is the first time history-based webcomics have come under theoretical scrutiny.

While digital methods are increasingly common in the humanities, the status of "Digital Humanities" has evolved over the years. Once a cutting-edge buzzword, DH has grown into a vast umbrella covering a myriad of scholarly activities that can nevertheless be a polarizing concept.
 
The purpose of this meeting of the Graduate Student Working Group in Digital Humanities is to have a candid discussion about strategies for talking about and representing digital work in professional contexts including but not limited to job interviews. It should be useful for students who have solid DH experience as well as those who are trying to decide how much time and energy to invest in digital work

Almost half of the respondents argued that they turn to Wikipedia to learn about history and acquire a historical understanding of the past. Wikipedia was ranked higher than other historical activities, such as “Historic site visit,” “Museum visit,” “Genealogy work,” “Social media,” “Podcast/radio program,” “History lecture,” and “History-related video game.” These findings combined with the appropriation of Wikipedia’s corpus by ChatGPT and Wikipedia’s partnership with the most central search engine in the digital world, Google, and other digital assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, make clear how crucial the role of Wikipedia in how the public learns about history …]]></summary>

The CLARIN2024 Annual Conference brought together academics and professionals from the wider humanities and social science communities to exchange ideas and experiences with the CLARIN infrastructure.
  


      




  
  
            
    
This year, the CLARIN Annual Conference was a hybrid event in Barcelona, Spain. With more than 200 in-person participants and close to 150 online participants, this was an engaging and successful event. In addition to engaging keynote speeches, more than 20 abstract presentations, and interactive poster sessions, the conference also included the very first Building Bridges with Industry session. And as it is now becoming a tradition, during the conference dinner, the CLARINets (i.e., the CLARIN band) d…]]></summary>

The CLARIN Resource Families (CRF) provide user-friendly overviews of available language resources in the CLARIN infrastructure for researchers from the digital humanities, social sciences and human language technologies. Many CRF are datasets of various types, including corpora, lexicons and software applications and tools. Until now, a missing resource family was the Corpora for Speech with Disorders (CSD), or the corpora with speech from individuals with language and speech disorders. 
    
CSD are invaluable resources for education and research. However, they are costly, hard to build, and can be difficult to share given various issues, such as the preservation of privacy and confidentiality of the participants, as …]]></summary>

Omeka is a content management system (CMS) designed by digital humanists at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. It allows you to create online collections and digital exhibits without knowing any code. Thinking about a tool like Omeka also gives us the opportunity to get into some of the most common questions in DH around maintenance, sustainability, collaboration, labor, digital representation, and the politics of metadata … and probably a few other things too. The goal of the workshop isn’t necessarily to promote Omeka (evene though it is an excellent tool for many applications) but rather to give you the information you need to decide if Omeka is right for you (and if it isn’t, what alternatives there might be).

In this workshop, I will introduce and demo a few very easy to use tools including:
Voyant (easy Text Analysis)
TimelineJS (easy Time Line builder)
StoryMapper (easy interactive maping)
 
I’ll also talk a little about free options for building quick websites. If you’ve already seen me do something like this before, it is unlikely that I will go over anything new so don’t feel compelled to come. On the other hand, if you haven’t seen it, it sounds like people often find it to be useful.

Stephanie Boddie, MSW, PhD, is an Associate Professor of Church and community Ministries at Baylor University, with appointments in their Garland School of Social Work and Truett Seminary. Amy Hillier, MSW, PhD, is an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy & Practice. The two were graduate school classmates at Penn and co-direct a public history project called The Ward: Race and Class in Du Bois’ Seventh Ward. The project aims to teach people about the great civil rights leader and scholar, W.E.B. Du Bois, and his 1899 book, The Philadelphia Negro through research, neighborhood walking tours, a documentary, interactive mapping, a board game, and oral histories. During this presentation, they will describe recent efforts to catalog and extend their project scope. They will demonstrate some of the current content and invite participants to help workshop ideas for their new website and the next phase of this 20-year-old project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This lecture first examines historical and contemporary patterns of human and non-human mobilizations that emerge when certain archival collections gain attention—earning archival value—from official institutions, professional archivists, critical scholars, and researchers. In this context, it is essential to consider the distinct intentions of both mainstream and alternative agents involved in these collections. Additionally, the varying motivations, methods, and means of visibly activating and utilizing these archives must be noted. As these dynamics unfold, questions arise concerning the limitations of accessibility, competition over full ownership and representation, and the ongoing debate between quantity and quality in archival practices. Building on my experience with Shubra’s Archive—Egypt’s first neighborhood-based community archive—the second part of the lecture expands on these questions and debates by integrating vernacular archival practices informed and performed by local residents and researchers. The main argument is that the presence of a place that ethnographically archives and engages with its space in the here and now opens up innovative situated ethical, logistical, and social endeavors. These endeavors not only interrogate the value-making processes of archival collections but also highlight the ruses and risks of aspiring toward exhaustive and accessible archives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In July 1843, after years of negotiation and resistance, the State of Ohio cast the last Native American tribe from its borders. Though the Wyandot reserved their legal right to remain until 1844, theft and land speculation by white settlers made staying in their homes untenable. Nearly 700 tribal citizens walked 240 kilometers from the Grand Reserve in Upper Sandusky to Cincinnati, Ohio. There, they boarded steamboats bound for unknown, unfamiliar lands in Kansas, over 1,150 kilometers away.
Ohio has forgotten about the Wyandot, as well as the larger story of their Removal and resistance. Wingo began a partnership with the the Cultural Division of the Wyandotte Nation in 2021 to reconstitute the Wyandot(te)’s legacy and repair Ohio’s historical amnesia. Their work consists of two (in-progress) community-based public history projects: the Wyandot Removal Trail and the Wyandot Heritage Digital Archive.
These projects are about reclamation as much as it is about Removal. Ohio, and the Midwest more broadly, mythologizes its past by laying claim to various freedoms: free from tyranny, free from slavery, and since 1843, also free from Indians. In coproducing this project, the Wyandotte are reclaiming control of their history, but how do they ensure the long term sustainability of these important resources?

The werewolf, on the other hand, has often been reduced to “the beast within,” or a psychoanalytic analogue for the bestial side of man. Phases of the Moon: A Cultural History of the Werewolf Film (2020) redresses the balance by providing wolf men and she-wolves with the same level of cultural analysis as has been afforded to their fellow monsters.

Games often engage with counterfactual history, exploring events that didn’t happen but might have, inviting players to consider not only how different outcomes could have shaped the world we live in today, but also why certain events unfolded the way they did.
For this new appointment with History@Play, the C²DH is proud to once again team up with Rotondes, Game On, and the BTS school of Game Programming and Game Design to explore how video games reimagine the past.
The GRAND SALLE will showcase a selection of video games that reimagine key historical moments and immerse players in alternate histories.
In the STUDIOS, we will present a historical board game workshop in collaboration with the BTS school of Game Programming and Game Design.
Working in teams, the participants will learn the ropes of game design by creating games that explore how different choices could have altered key moments in Luxembourg’s history.

To help with the research, I converted all the PDF volumes of the Post Office Directories into a public, online, searchable database. Or at least, I thought I had.
The Tasmanian Post Office Directories database embeds metadata about each line of text in its results, so it’s easy to save items of interest using Zotero.

The talk will present research findings that will be published in a monograph in 2024 answering the research question: ‘What were the living and working conditions of Soviet forced laborers in Luxembourg during World War II, as seen from German, American, and Soviet documentation, and what impact did these experiences have on their lives after their return?’ The internal seminar for C²DH is especially informative since several camps for young civilians from Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, as well as for Soviet prisoners of war, were located on the Belval University campus, which is situated on the site of the former ARBED steelworks using the forced labor during WWII.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To understand the internet, one must understand advertising. But what is advertising, exactly? Is it simply a way to inform consumers about products and services? Is it large companies gathering consumer data? Hidden technologies for tracking and profiling? Public policies regulating data markets or leaving them unfettered?
Advertising is all these things and more. In this talk, Matthew Crain will outline a political economic approach to advertising, foregrounding the concepts of social relations and structural power.

        <id>http://wragge.micro.blog/2024/09/23/major-update-for.html</id>
        <link href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2024/09/23/major-update-for.html"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Trove newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench was updated last week. Over the last year I’ve been gradually updating notebooks to use version 3 of the Trove API, but when version 2 suddenly disappeared a couple of weeks ago I had to hurriedly pull everything together. The Trove newspapers section includes 23 notebooks and 6 datasets, so it’s not a small job. The changes include:
updated all notebooks to use version 3 of the Trove API
removed remaining datasets from the code repository and created dedicated data repositories for them, integrating them with Zenodo where appropriate
added metadata to all the notebooks – this is used to build an RO-Crate metadata file for the code repository
updated all the Python packages
added a voila.json file to configure Voilá
None of the functionality of the notebooks should have changed. There’s a slight difference in the Finding non-English newspapers in Trove notebook because the language detection library I was using is no longer maintained. I’ve swapped in py3langid and it seems to work well, though the results are a little different. Interestingly, where the previous library thought that bad OCR was ‘Maltese’, the new one detects it as ‘Latin’! There’s no change to the list of newspapers with non-English language content detected by the notebook.

The documentation pages have also been updated. The notebook pages are now built using data from the code repository’s RO-Crate file. They also include embedded HTML previews of the notebooks. If a notebook generates visualisations, the visualisations are usually included in the HTML, so you can explore the outputs without running the notebook – see, for example, the charts in Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state. Most of the dataset pages now include links to explore the contents using Datasette-Lite.
I still have to generate RO-Crate files for all the data repositories, but I wanted to get the code stuff finished first.]]></summary>

I’m certain that the historiographical implications of the growth and development of online collections will become a topic of increasing interest to historians, and that exploration of this topic will lead to important insights into the relationship between what we keep, what we value, and what we know. But for this to happen we need to have data documenting changes in online collections. What became available when? How was it delivered to users? How did the search indexing work?

623 Williams Hall



Dr. Tajah Ebram will talk about her current work with The Black Bibliography Project (BBP). The BBP is creating a digital database of Black book history with the aim of revealing the dynamic social networks and aesthetic practices specific to Black print cultures in the U.S.  During her talk, she will discuss her background in Black literary and cultural studies and how this informs her current work with the BBP. Her current research with the project is focused on developing and curating, in collaboration with graduate researchers, a corpus centering the print cultures of books authored by incarcerated Black writers and organizers of the late 20th century. The talk will explore the print cultures of Black prison movements while also attending to critical political, ethical and descriptive considerations involved in developing data about these works and writers. 

Dr. Tajah Ebram is a cultural historian, teacher and community memory worker. She is currently the Black Studies Librarian at Rutgers University New Brunswick and the Rutgers lead for the Black Bibliography Project. Prior to her work at Rutgers, she was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Haverford College where she developed seminars around Black feminisms, carceral studies and Black environmentalism.  In 2020, she completed her PhD in English at the University of Pennsylvania where she focused on Philly Black freedom movements through the lenses of oral history, digital storytelling, and material culture.

There was already a notebook in the GLAM Workbench that downloads the issues of a digitised newspaper as PDFs, but newspapers work differently to other digitised periodicals in Trove. While there was no corresponding notebook for other types of periodicals, all the necessary steps were documented in the Trove Data Guide, so it was just a matter of pulling together a few blocks of code.
There are three main steps:
get the nla.obj identifiers for all the periodical’s issues
get the number of pages in each issue
construct a url to download each issue as a PDF using the nla.obj identifier and the number of pages

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This interdisciplinary conference aims to explore the multifaceted roles of sports, culture, and arts in shaping diverse European societies throughout history. By going beyond traditional narratives of labour and economy, we seek to examine how these realms intersect with societal dynamics, identity formation, and community cohesion.
Migration has long served as a conduit for the exchange and diffusion of sporting traditions, artistic expressions, and cultural identities across borders and continents. Similarly, sports, culture and arts serve as powerful mediums through which migrants navigate and negotiate their identities, fostering inclusion among migrant populations. This dynamic exchange between migration and what lies beyond work not only shapes the cultural landscapes of host nations but also enriches the global fabric of human experience.
The annual event is co-organised by the Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations Humaines (CDMH), a long-time AEMI member; the Ville de Dudelange and the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH).
 
See the detailed programme.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many questions are currently being asked about the practice of history: archives are being transformed, tools have changed, as have the logics and players involved in disseminating historical research. How do we choose among the many paths open to us today? The “Taste of the archive in the digital age” project, carried out since 2017 with Frédéric Clavert, aimed in part to describe these new practices of history; it led to a reflection on the nature of the links that bind us to the archive. Certain parts of this documentation have become unstable, such as “family” archives, which have hitherto survived in attics or trunks, and are now flows that disappear at the same time as our smartphones and their photo albums. Around these questions gravitate “worlds”: archivists, the “public”, students, publishers... what specific contributions can historians make in this galaxy?

Christine Roughan is a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Center for Digital Humanities and with Manuscript, Rare Book and Archive Studies. Christine earned her Ph.D. in the Ancient World from New York University in January 2023, where her doctoral work explored a premodern astronomical curriculum and its continued use in Greek and Arabic between the second and thirteenth centuries CE. Christine's research applies computational approaches to the study of manuscript transmissions in the Mediterranean world, particularly of mathematical and scientific works. During her postdoctoral term at Princeton, Christine is leveraging deep learning tools to classify and analyze visual data from digitized manuscripts, with a particular focus on paratextual material.
The written outputs of manuscript cultures are often characterized by a degree of multiformity, and certain texts see particularly high amounts of variation. Works used for didactic purposes, for instance, often saw multiple interventions in the hands of contemporary scholars and teachers. While digital imaging initiatives have made great strides in making manuscript materials more accessible, the fact that this data is in image format has until recently presented a speedbump for research that would grapple with such highly variable traditions. But this is changing with the machine learning technologies available today. This talk will explore how these tools can facilitate access at scale into the texts of digitized manuscript collections, as well as support research into material beyond the main text column, whether that material is textual (e.g., marginal annotations) or visual (e.g., scientific diagrams).

Led by Myriam Dalal and Thomas Cauvin, researchers from the University of Luxembourg, this project uses oral history and art to give a voice to several Portuguese-speaking grandmothers residing in Esch-sur-Alzette, who have made this city their home.

The past
Commonwealth Hansard is made available online through ParlInfo (there’s an alternative search interface here). The Parliamentary Library has invested a lot of time and effort in  converting the printed volumes into nicely-structured XML files which break up the sitting day into debates and speeches, and identify individual speakers. For the most part, there’s one XML file for each sitting day in each house. However, there’s currently a gap between 1981 and 1997 where no XML files are available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project Start Date: 

August, 2024



El Movimiento Audiovisual en Nuevitas (MAN) hace referencia a la gestión comunitaria (producción, alfabetización audiovisual, exhibición y distribución) que un grupo de jóvenes viene desarrollando en esta localidad desde el año 2007. Esta iniciativa en principio se encuentra deslindada de la institución política-cultural oficial cubana. Responde al concurso de los esfuerzos de sus integrantes y de los pobladores del municipio. En materia de formación profesional artística el núcleo central proviene de las Escuelas de Instructores de Arte en las especialidades de Teatro, Plástica, Música y Danza. La curva de aprendizaje en materia de realización audiovisual se sustenta en la práctica y participación en talleres, conferencias, cursos, festivales y otras experiencias educativa-formativas. Hasta la fecha se han producido alrededor de 100 materiales entre ficciones, documentales, videos musicales, video arte y carteles. Desde el año 2012 organizan la muestra de audiovisuales Hieroscopia con carácter anual. En ella se exhiben tanto las obras producidas por el MAN como de otros espacios de producción comunitaria en Cuba. El encuentro sirve también para el intercambio teórico sobre la práctica audiovisual aprovechando la presencia de realizadores, críticos, periodistas y en general, personal disímil que se dedica a lo cinematográfico en la isla. Por la constancia en el trabajo, la gestión de espacios para la creación y el debate y la vocación por la superación técnica y estética, el MAN se ha convertido en un foco del audiovisual cubano contemporáneo.

As one of the main cultural sites where public history is engaged, museums play a critical role in not only educating the public, but, increasingly, learning from the public about the past, and its significance in the present and future. Ongoing calls for deeper and more diverse forms of participation, power sharing, and collaboration have brought a wider range of perspectives and participants into the processes of producing history for public engagement. But museum practitioners’ engagement with children often remains stuck in outmoded, hierarchical dynamics that fail to recognize children’s capacities as contributors and collaborators in public historical work.

I use Zotero as my personal research database, capturing publications, websites, PDFs, as well as records from a growing number of GLAM collections. You can add tags and notes to items, organise them into collections, and annotate PDFs and website captures. You can also share your collections, create groups to collaborate with others, and acc…]]></summary>

Across the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, an estimated 1,600 communities of color were destroyed by highway construction. Rondo was one of these neighborhoods, sacrificed to the asphalt as cities across the country weaponized their arteries by building “white roads through Black bedrooms.”
Marvin Anderson remembers what the City of St. Paul did to his neighborhood, and he has made it his life’s mission to Remember Rondo. In 2015, Mr. Anderson and Rebecca Wingo joined forces to create RememberingRondo.org, a vibrant history hub with a community-based digital archive, a map of Rondo’s historic businesses, and much more.

But while historians and archivists share a common interest in archived information, their vision of material relevance and record-keeping occasionally differ. Additionally to this ancient divide, digital archiving has brought new challenges for both communities.
In this paper, I will first discuss conceptual continuity lines between analog and digital archiving of textual material at a general level. In a second step, I will examine both analog and digital archiving under the lens of their environmental footprint and the challenges it brings about in a context of resource shortage like the climate and biodiversity crisis. I will not concentrate solely on strategies pertaining to the archived material itself, but w…]]></summary>

Professor of History of Art



Julie Nelson Davis specializes in the arts and material cultures of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Japan, with a focus on prints, paintings, and illustrated books. One of the leaders in the field of ukiyo-e (“images of the floating world”), Davis takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding these works in context, exploring issues related to artistic practice, authorship, gender, and censorship, among others. Selected as a Guggenheim Fellow for 2021, Davis is working on a new project about imitation, homage, and fabrication in ukiyo-e painting as well as second project on artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) and illustrated books.

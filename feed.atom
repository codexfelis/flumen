An easy way to think of IIIF is like a webpage. A webpage is built with HTML, via hypertext markup language. It pulls together text, images, and other multimedia into a single view. In the same way, a IIIF object is built using JSON, and links together metadata and powerful image capabilities which allow institutions to deliver ultra-high resolution images quickly and efficiently to a IIIF viewer. Any image (and even audio and video) can become a IIIF object by building a manifest that uses the IIIF standard to describe its]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction: This article explores the potential use of data-driven methods to visualise and interpret the impact of Western efforts to influence Cold War dynamics using a covert book distribution programme. Based on a documentary corpus connected to the 2013 book by Alfred Reisch, which documented efforts by the CIA to disseminate books in the Soviet Bloc in the period 1956-1971, the authors use the Tableau Public platform to re-assess information science methods for researching historical events. Their analysis suggests that books distributed did not tend to have a more obvious political slant, but were more likely to have a broader universalist outlook. While it skirts around some of the limitations of visualization (highlighted elsewhere by Drucker and others) it offers a solid introduction to the benefits of a data-driven approach to a general audience.]]></summary>

The Force11 Working Group Reimagining Educational Practices for Open (REPO) will be hosting its second webinar on Jun 30, 2021 at 13:00 UTC.
Community Open Principles: Before, During and After the Global Pandemic
Dr. Ana Persic, UNESCO,
Dr. Arianna Becerril García, AmeliCA,
Dr. Johanna Havemann, Open Science MOOC,
Osman Aldirdiri, AfricArXiv
When we talk about Open (Open Science, Open Data, Open Access) what do we mean? How can we navigate the different definitions of what it means to be a community and to be Open? How do we engage with communities and train members around Open? What evidence are we using of how we are addressing Open? How can we be more inclusive and align our Open principles to foster norms, incentives, and recognition? Have our understandings around Open shifted during the pandemic? 
This online webinar will address these questions via the experiences of invited open science communities, how they have designed and applied their open (science) principles before and during the pandemic, particularly with regard to outreach and training, while also looking out at the horizon, at a future beyond the pandemic. The webinar aims to include open (science) perspectives from a diverse group of communities, learn from their approaches, how they have evolved, and identify possible next steps that all, in our global community can consider.

CDH Webinar: ‘Mediating sustainable cities: a methodological approach’, presented by Paola Monachesi



Date/Time
Date(s) - 28-05-2021
15:00 - 16:15
Location
Online
Registration through the following link: Centre for Digital Humanities | CDH Webinar: 'Mediating sustainable cities: a methodological approach', presented by Paola Monachesi (uu.nl)
On 28 May, the Utrecht Centre for Digital Humanities organises a webinar in which Dr Paola Monachesi (Languages, Literature and Communication, Utrecht University) presents a podcast series under development focusing on her research on urban sustainable development.
Environmental sustainability
In her research, Monachesi takes a communication approach to urban sustainable development. She focuses on social behaviour analysed on the basis of communication arising from social media data. She claims that data ownership is key to digital and environmental sustainability.
Social media data
In this webinar Monachesi presents the computational methodology she developed to analyse social media data that exploits the linguistic, communicative and relational characteristics of the users. She focuses on two communities: creative migrants and elderly. In order to reveal the more implicit meaning of the data, she combines her quantitative analysis with a qualitative, thematic analysis in a novel mixed-method approach based on an explanatory sequential emergent design.
Podcast and debate
Attendants will listen to 3 podcasts of about 10-15 mins addressing the methodology. There will be space to ask questions and have a debate about the approach, results of the analysis and the relation between digital and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, there will be the possibility to comment and give feedback on the podcast series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction: In this paper, Ehrlicher et al. follow a quantitative approach to unveil possible structural parallelisms between 13 comedies and 10 autos sacramentales written by Calderón de la Barca. Comedies are analyzed within a comparative framework, setting them against Spanish comedia nueva and French comedie precepts. Authors employ tool DramaAnalysis and statistics for their examination, focusing on: word frequency per subgenre, average number of characters, their variation and discourse distribution, etc. Autos sacramentales are also evaluated through these indicators. Regarding comedies, Ehrlicher et al.’s results show that Calderón: a) plays with units of space and time depending on creative and dramatic needs, b) does not follow French comedie conventions of character intervention or linkage, but c) does abide by its concept of structural symmetry. As for autos sacramentales, their findings brought forth that these have a similar length and character variation to comedies. However, they also identified the next difference: Calderón uses character co-presence in them to reinforce the message conveyed. Considering all this, authors confirm that Calderón’s comedies disassociate from classical notions of theatre – both Aristotelian and French –ideals. With respect to autos sacramentales, they believe further evaluation would be needed to verify ideas put forward and identify other structural patterns.]]></summary>

This book chapter describes a web-based tool called CATMA which  promises a "low-threshold" approach to digitally encoded text interpretation. CATMA has a long trajectory based on a 'standoff' approach to markup, somewhat provocatively described by its creators as "undogmatic", which stands in contrast to more established systems for text representation in digital scholarly editing and publishing such as XML markup, or the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).

Thanks to the contribution provided by four Working Groups (respectively dealing with Scholarly Resources, Methods and Tools, Literary Theory and History, and Dissemination: https://www.distant-reading.net/working-groups/ ), the project aims at providing at least 2,500 novels written in ten European languages with a range of Distant Reading computational tools and methodological strategies to approach them from various perspectives (textual, stylistic, topical, et similia). A full description of the objectives of the Action and of ELTeC can be found and read in the Memorandum of Understanding for the implementation of the COST Action “Distant Reading for European Literary History” (DISTANT-READING) CA 16204”, available at the link  https://e-services.cost.eu/files/domain_files/CA/Action_CA16204/mou/CA16204-e.pdf

A central concern of NLP research is that for many of their users, these models still largely operate as black boxes with limited reflections on why the model makes certain predictions, how their usage is skewed towards certain content types, what are the underlying social, cultural biases etc.  The open source Language Interoperability Tool  aim to change this for the better and brings transparency to the visualization and understanding of NLP models.

It's been a multi-step process, including some XSLT, some Python, some OpenRefine, and I've kept notes along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction: Standing for 'Architecture of Knowledge', ArCo is an open set of resources developed and managed by some Italian institutions, like the MiBAC (Minister for the Italian Cultural Heritage) and, within it, the ICCD - Institute of the General Catalogue and Documentation), and the CNR - Italian National Research Council. Through the application of eXtreme Design (XD), ArCO basically consists in an ontology network comprising seven modules (the arco, the core, the catalogue, the location, the denotative description, the context description, and the cultural event) and a set of LOD data comprising a huge amount of linked entities referring to the national Italian cultural resources, properties and events. Under constant refinement, ArCo represents an example of a "robust Semantic Web resource" (Carriero et al., 11) in the field of cultural heritage, along with other projects like, just to mention a couple of them, the Google Arts&Culture (https://artsandculture.google.com/) or the Smithsonian American Art Museum (https://americanart.si.edu/about/lod).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) Awards Committee is seeking nominations for the 2022 Antonio Zampolli Prize.
The Zampolli Prize is a triennial award that recognizes a single output in the field of Digital Humanities by any scholar or scholars at any stage of their career(s). As such, it offers a unique opportunity to reward individual projects that either have been formative or had a decisive impact on the field as a whole. Because the prize is awarded to the overall project, the recipients can be a single individual or a collaborative group of scholars, researchers, and/or practitioners. The output recognized can take any form: published research, developed resources, an established initiative, and/or center or tool(s) for research, for example. To be eligible for the prize, the nominated project must involve the innovative scholarly use of information and communications technologies.
We urge you, as members of the field, to take this opportunity to offer recommendations for outstanding work that you feel deserves recognition. Nominations will be accepted until 23:59 UTC on 01 September 2021. A winner will be announced during the winter of 2021-2022 and the prize will be awarded at the 2022 DH conference.
Nominations should consist of a document (1500-2000 words) describing the work to be nominated and the individual(s) involved, paying special attention to the relevance and importance of this work to the field as a whole. Please include a brief description of the work, a discussion of its innovative use of information technology and, particularly, the importance of this project to the Digital Humanities. Self-nominations will not be accepted. Please address nominations to the ADHO Awards Committee and send electronic copies to awards [at] adho [dot] org.
Note: Any previous nominations should be resubmitted.
For further information, including the terms of the award and protocols for its selection, please visit ADHO’s Zampolli Prize web page.
